AutoModerator,t2_6l4z3,FALSE,TRUE,"
Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

1. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

If you would like to keep the Medium Diesels, I would still recommend running less generators faster. You may generate a little less power but save a lot of weight that way and you may be able to gear up your propellers. I also hear that using azimuth thrusters as your main props can give you a boost in speed on small and medium sized ships. I have not confirmed this but it's worth a look at. 

On my Diesel-Electric I have an ""eco mode"" that has the gearboxes setup to run the engines at \~7.5 rps which generates \~3700 swatts and gives the ship 190km range @ 11m/s.

You need to be a realist to see a viable path, and you need to have an understanding of the available technology. most paths are either to feeble, centrist plans, or so extreme and unrealistic and head in the clouds they will self implode and go nowhere, bernies. For example, bernie is very anti-nuclear, every decarbonization study ever made states that having nuclear be a part of the decarbonization equation makes decarbonization much much much more viable, he's also clueless, he thinks batteries can replace nuclear in a decade, but he knows nil about the city scale battery technological trajectory, if america actually tried to follow his plan it would waste a boat load of money and then have to find something to replace his failed battery policy, not to mention the economic and political backlash it would cause.

The actual path really isn't that complicated. For example in america the optimal plan calls for a 20-40% nuclear base load plus 80,000 of the new high atmosphere giga-wind turbines. That would cover almost all of americas electricity use. From there the rest of the world can be tackled by a combination of tariffs and sanctions for polluting countries and by under-cutting their energy markets by building Giga-factories that pour out giga-wind turbines by the hundreds of thousands.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874786,2020-05-18T23:53:06Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xu0r,fr2xu0r,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gm0lz4,t1_fr2xu0r,TRUE,t1_fr2v462,/r/worldnews/comments/gm0lz4/china_has_set_an_80_per_cent_tariff_on_imports_of/fr2xu0r/,1,gm0lz4,worldnews,t5_2qh13,0,1,2020-05-18T23:53:09Z

oishster,t2_qqljk,FALSE,FALSE,"I‚Äôm an AP bio tutor, I‚Äôve been doing this for years now, and I gotta say, this year‚Äôs kids were straight up screwed over in all ways. First of all, having the test be only on half the year‚Äôs material - which I know was unavoidable, but still, really unfair, since most students find evolution and ecology to be the easiest topics. Not to mention, for those who are going into Bio as a major, not knowing evolution and ecology can be a serious drawback. I don‚Äôt even know how colleges are going to treat these scores - will they really accept these as equivalents for passing introductory bio courses when literally half of an intro bio course is evolution-based?!

And then having the test be only free response - I tutor a lot of students who are recent immigrants to USA, they understand the concepts really well but struggle with writing because English is not their native language. They had to work twice as hard these past two months trying to acclimatize to an all-FRQ test where they don‚Äôt have a cushion of multiple choice to boost their score. This test was more English comprehension than biology, from what I‚Äôm hearing.

And what was most infuriating for me was the lack of practice material that properly mirrored the format of this year‚Äôs new test. They changed the test beginning this year so none of the practice material from previous years really has anything quite as long as these questions. The ‚Äú2020 Sample Questions‚Äù document had ONE question - and while that question WAS long with multiple figures, the questions hadn‚Äôt even been edited to reflect the new no-evolution update. The mock exams on YouTube were also significantly easier than what I‚Äôm hearing from my students and from this subreddit. And just so much widespread confusion about what the test would consist of and how things would be tested! They absolutely could have and should have organized and updated their website better to properly reflect the changes being made.

And finally, only 30 minutes given to read/comprehend/analyze multiple graphs and paragraphs of new information, and fully answer 10 questions is straight up ridiculous. I know they were trying to prevent having enough time to cheat, but doing all that in 30 minutes would be a challenge even for actual college students, let alone high school students who have had to use distance learning and basically self-teach themselves for the past two months.

I dated a woman long distance for about 4 months and she was unhappily married. We broke up because she decided to work things out with her husband and I was heartbroken. We were best friends and she was going to move down here to the US from the UK. Our plans were derailed by her husband giving her the ultimatum that she either move out or try to work it out with him. She chose to work it out with him, and I was left alone. 

We stayed friends, and still talk everyday, but I now do not feel that I can even open up to her about a lot of things. I am now in a relationship that is going quite well, but i still cannot open up to my ex. I've distanced myself from her and I now keep things on a purely surface level when I talk to her. We've talked on Skype a few times since we've broken up, and the last time we talked, I found it awkward because I find it hard to open up to her when she broke my heart. Am I the asshole in this scenario? For not being able to open up to her?

The oil rig scene was great. Wish there was more of that in the 3rd act. Instead we get Clark making out with Lois atop the ashes of destruction and death. That just didn't feel right. That's not Superman. Thats not Clark Kent. Completely stupid moment that goes against his character. 

Clark was raised in a farm in middle America, a very idealistic region in the usa. The way he came off in MOS didn't reflect that at all. He was broody, unsure of himself most of the time, even petty(when he shoved huge trees in the truck drivers truck). Captain America in the MCU feels more like Superman than Superman does in MOS.

First, beware of ego knowledge that is only there to satisfy the intellect and not help do useful things.

Second, make sure you also get someone who is knowledgeable to help explain things or you might find yourself coming to wrong conclusions. Don't forget that sufi books and manuals are also mystic documents in and of themselves and are also very refrential and precise in language - so be of those who listen and follow what is best.

What doesnt make sense or isnt completely clear to you should be clarified and explained properly before you put it into use.

Some things to consider with this approach:
- Ensure that you aren‚Äôt fetching any more than you need to (accidentally fetching every render or other simple mistakes. Go into the networking panel to double check this as it will have a big impact on responsiveness)

- Ensure that your game‚Äôs server validates every move a player makes. Since each player has their own copy of the deck it‚Äôs more likely than usual for someone‚Äôa frontend to make a mistake. There‚Äôs also the case of someone trying to spoof your game so this should be done regardless of your approach

Why

Dear /u/notavalidsource!

Thank you for posting on /r/resumes. Please, let we mention some important information (probably you know it).

[Wiki Guidelines about Posting a Resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index#wiki_posting_a_resume)

Please, remember to add a **flair** to your post.

Due to the extremely increasing amount of spam/scam on the sub as posts, comments, in PM, and via GoogleAds on Reddit, we have to warn everyone about it. Unfortunately, such offers imply low-quality service - and actually, they are. Such scammers were banned, and there was some feedback on their work. So please, do not trust shady offers.  
One can find trusted professionals on the wiki - there is such a list.

We wish you get support from the sub in many ways, including reading it, top posts, wiki, and searching. There were many answered questions here, please, feel free to check that.

Besides, this subreddit is better looking in the old Reddit design on the desktop in the browser with adBlockers (FireFox/PaleMoon with uBlock Origin + uMatrix): https://old.reddit.com/r/resumes/

I hope that row of bars isn't sold for development or the college experience in Gainesville will be reduced to nothing.

Running Bromine ???    Get about 4 tabs in it add the tabs weekly.  Open so you can see 2-3 tabs 

When you use the tub and your done give it a cap or two of non chlorine shock.    

Remember you will always fight with high PH. So I keep my alkalinity around 60- 70 to keep PH in check.   If you have air which creates bubbles     Make sure it is shut off when you close the lid 

Don‚Äôt battle with the water.    Drain and start again if needed.      I use a submergible pump.  40 min to drain.   1 hr to fill.     Every 3 months. 


Use the same suits.    Don‚Äôt wash them in the laundry   If you do wash them.   Rinse the shut out of them by hand so there isn‚Äôt and soap in the suits.    THIS WILL STOP THE FOAM, any one comes over I guarantee they have a Soapy suit and then your right back to square one. 

In a nut shell.   Add some shock when your done to bring the bromine back up 

Get a good test kit 

Use same suits.  Don‚Äôt keep washing them 


Remember if your bromine is at 3 or 4. Just saying and 2 to 3 people are in the tub for 20 minutes you‚Äôll have no brining left, so if you don‚Äôt add some school to the tub after using it. 

It would take a a day to get the tabs to create 3 - 4 bromine again.

I don‚Äôt think there is anything stopping them from just ‚Äúnot stopping in the cadia system‚Äù.

The Mandeville point is just the closest area of space that isn‚Äôt within the gravity well of a planet or asteroid field. There‚Äôs nothing stopping you just warping though it and continuing your journey. 

> Conservatively to avoid too much Necron techhandwavium, I would suggest the mandeville is bigger than the Cadian Gate...thus you must pass through the Cadian system, out one end of the mandeville and through the other, before being cleared to use warp drives.

IIRC Cadia is a fairly dense system with a few minor planets surrounding Cadia itself. So there won‚Äôt be too many points you can safely exit warpspace. 

Also, the Mandeville point can‚Äôt be bigger than the Cadian gate. Swap ‚ÄúMandeville point‚Äù with ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù and ‚ÄúCadian gate‚Äù for ‚ÄúCadian system.‚Äù 

So it then becomes:

sansa-starkers-,t2_5ux9lvh0,FALSE,FALSE,"Everyone gets down and hits a rut sometimes. You need to remember onlyfans is a business. You are taking the successes/ failures too personally as though you as a person are not good enough when in reality you have just not honed your marketing and your strategy, it has very little to do with the content really. The issue here is that you are working too hard and spending too much and not valuing what you are producing highly enough. 10 minute wanking videos everyday is too much to be posting on the feed and you are devaluing your product. Sometimes the need to see success quickly can overwhelm and that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs tempting to do sales and put out really generous content in the hope to see some instant feedback/subscribers. It takes time to build up fans and find subscribers who are going to become regulars and interact/ support you in a more personal way. 

Reduce the explicit content you have on your onlyfans feed. For your sub price I think 3/ 4 photo sets a week and maybe 1 explicit video every 2 weeks is more than fair. Daily full length videos is VASTLY undervaluing yourself. Try some content that is focused on getting to know you- cute chatty videos/ dancing/ anything you can think of to show your personality. If people connect to you as a person they are much more likely to stick around and interact as they are invested in a person not just a body. Think about why onlyfans appeals when there‚Äôs millions of free explicit videos in every category all over the internet. It appeals because guys want to connect to REAL GIRLS. It is massively more important to show who you are and what makes you unique and relatable than it is to try and produce high quality porn. Onlyfans creators are mainly ‚Äòamateur‚Äô self shooting girls so don‚Äôt forget that this is a different market to professional porn and has it own appeal.

Please don‚Äôt be discouraged. It takes time to find the right formula/ techniques to make a business work. Hardly anyone is an overnight success, it takes time and a willingness to try new things. Take a break from making content, it sounds like you have more than enough and focus that energy on your image and marketing strategy.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874825,2020-05-18T23:53:45Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xwj7,fr2xwj7,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gmc12c,t1_fr2xwj7,TRUE,t3_gmc12c,/r/onlyfansadvice/comments/gmc12c/im_feeling_so_hopeless_and_discouraged/fr2xwj7/,1,gmc12c,onlyfansadvice,t5_2mfwt3,0,1,2020-05-18T23:53:47Z
