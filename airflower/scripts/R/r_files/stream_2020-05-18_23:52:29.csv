kohugaly,t2_avk5p9j,FALSE,FALSE,"You have to treat the phenomenon of obstruction as a function of time and you have to treat waiting near a dynamic obstacle as a valid move.

Let's assume you are using Dijkstra/A\* and you have a function ""is\_tile\_obstructed"". You can pass current G-value (aka the current length of the path) to that function as a parameter. The function returns one of 3 values (free, statically blocked, dynamically blocked). The function estimates whether some entity is expected to obstruct the tile by the time the pathfinder would reach that spot. \*\*

If any of a tile's neighbours is dynamically obstructed, then also treat the tile itself as its own neighbour (aka the option to wait). This way, the pathfinding algorithm checks both alternative route and original route with a short stop (during which ideal path may have become unobstructed and could still result in shorter path despite the stop). 

&#x200B;

\*\* this can be as simple or complex as you like. Faraway tiles may simply return free, because any dynamic obstruction is unlikely to be there by the time pathfinder reaches it. Nearby tiles that have entity on them can check whether the entity will have moved away by the time pathfinder reaches it. They can also check whether some nearby entity is about to move on them by that time. Whenever entity finds its path, it can mark all tiles along the path with time-stamps to inform other pathfinders about its future obstruction. etc. etc.

This approach can do crazy things. For example, it may allow a unit to correctly pathfind through corridors with trapdoors that periodically activate. It is possible to check whether a trapdoor is open at any point in time. If the trap activates while the entity would stand on it, it can be treated as dead end (aka the entity died of falling in). The entity´s path resulting from this will include stopping and waiting to time the path perfectly.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874171,2020-05-18T23:42:51Z,NA,0,t1_fr2wpf6,fr2wpf6,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gm6s31,t1_fr2wpf6,TRUE,t3_gm6s31,/r/roguelikedev/comments/gm6s31/path_finding_with_moving_obstacles/fr2wpf6/,1,gm6s31,roguelikedev,t5_2si41,0,1,2020-05-18T23:42:52Z

I just feel like we have all the evidence. Its right there. All you have to do is pay attention and do a little research from unbiased sources.  Yet there is a growing number of people that just don't believe anything except what Trump says.

I deeply feel that the only way for these Trump supporters to get a different perspective is to shake their worlds to the core, so they can see the truth because there is nothing else left for them. They need their lives torn apart. They need to get so sick they almost die, or to see their loved ones go through it. And they need to deal with the aftermath of medical bills too. 

What else is going to make the insanity stop? I don't want anyone to suffer but if their suffering will help others not suffer in the future, ill happily take it. 

Plus, I feel like those that are putting others lives at risk by denying the virus should be the ones to get sick. 

I know its not the kindest way to look at it, but I don't care about these people that wish so much suffering on others.

10% are actually withdrawing money to pay themselves a wage, like a job. 

You can trade and make money without paying yourself a wage. Just compound it, grow your account until you reach a point where you can withdraw profits, keep some part in to grow your account, and be comfortable.

ClericNeokun,t2_czwmvyb,FALSE,FALSE,"I finally figured it out. It was all because of the avatar's shorter arm length compared to mine. When I have my hands completely relaxed to my sides, it's literally dragging down the avatar's upper body which is why it looks like it's running at a much lower profile than normal. 

There is a quite a bit of a margin before this becomes an issue for someone however. In my case, ingame height adjustments just within a foot of my actual height work smoothly. Beyond that and the height difference starts really affecting the avatar's posture both in idle and during the sprint animation.

This sucks because I really like that avatar.

The problem is that there's a ""pipeline"" from mainstream feminism to TERFism. See: JK Rowling, who is famous for being the poster child of white liberalism and not ""radical"" in either sense of the word. It's great that most feminist communities ban overt transphobes, but that's the bare minimum. Androphobia and transphobia are part of the same spectrum of bigotry, and when a community is constantly swapping stories about how shitty men can be and anyone who calls out unfair generalizations is ridiculed for being ""fragile"" and banned for ""tone policing"" that community is reinforcing the ideas that underly TERFism.

Kujo17,t2_zz512,FALSE,FALSE,"In my opinion I'm really co fused why they are classifying this separately from covid at all especislly because weve know from the beginning that COVID- original NCP short for Novel Coronary Pnemonia to highlight the coronary issues specifically- literally is known to cause *every single one* of these same symptoms. The only one that seems to stick out as not familiar to me is the tongue swelling which seems similar to an allergic reaction, which is caused by histamines released by the immune system thus still fitting that same bill.


I wonder if these cases will now be counted separately from the covid cases aswell. Sure seems like another. way-  pure speculation here on my part- to purposefully muddy the waters surrounding the totals and once again give the false illusion we are doing better than we really are , if that turns out to be the case. 


Also curious as the original chinese totals at a noticeable lack of children even though it is irrefutable that children are affected. I doubt we will ever know in less someone leaks info from China, but I wonder if they too kept a seperate tally of children under a seperate name. 


Given the symptoms overlap pretty much entirely and the symptoms are caused by the exact same virus, one just happens to not be as present in the lungs specifically but effectively works the same way it is *extremely concerning* to me that this is being referenced as a completely seperate disease and is something I think peolle definitely should keep a close eye on in the next few months. 

Specifically on all of those asylptimatic patients- much like children up until recently had been classified- that make up a majority of all covid cases to begin with. I truly hope this does not start presenting in those aswell. 


Idk guys... my spidey sense is tingling here much as it has a few times has throughout this at different times. 🧐

icyflakes,t2_5kvmy,FALSE,FALSE,"For the most part yes, you're right. But in the VFL, you see a few of the reserve sides with AFL-heavy squads, still getting their shit kicked in by loc sides. Port Melbourne and Williamstown in particular, although they're definitly the exception to the rule.

  


We've been conditioned in Victoria to only care about AFL, but if you had this division system there is a potential it drives people to care more for the local teams. It also would probably kill the smaller clubs if they get relegated though. I think the biggest issue we have is that, being a salary capped league, you don't get the English style of some magnate buying up a smaller club and throwing cash around to build it up. I think it's a good thing overall, but it means less chance of growing the smaller clubs, and just increasing the gaps.

  


Above anything else, it's probably just a population issue.

It could even be the opposite, that they been sitting on this footage for a while but were not getting enough footage to make a release from these specific provinces.

In my opinion it is fairly significant and shows the insurgency is probably gaining some steam after some dwindling in 2018 - 19.

newkiwiguy,t2_y78jf,FALSE,FALSE,"This sub hates these posts with the fire of a thousand suns.  But personally I don't mind them, being I'm an American immigrant myself.  So I'll give you a few quick answers while I put off doing real work.  

Healthcare is far better than the US. The vast majority of people rely on the public system and are happy with it.  You won't have to pay for any private health insurance.  The life expectancy is higher than the US, diseases lower.  

Climate depends where you live in NZ! Parts of rural South Island have 4 seasons similar to New England.  Coastal South Island and Lower North Island are like the Pacific Northwest, so think Seattle.  Auckland and the upper North Island are more like California, especially San Francisco but without the fog.  

The government is a million times better than the US. It is competent and widely trusted, with 91% approval of the measures taken to stop the virus.  The electoral system is fair and voter turnout above 80% consistently.  Your vote actually matters here and the outcome of the election means something. The minority party can't block legislation, there is no separation of powers.  When a party wins, they make real changes and much more quickly than the US.  

The minimum wage is $18.90/hour, about the highest in world compared to median wage.  

Quality of life is very good in my opinion and surveys show Kiwis are happier than Americans on average.  But of course that's highly dependent on you and what you want in life.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874224,2020-05-18T23:43:44Z,NA,0,t1_fr2wswn,fr2wswn,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gmcrnb,t1_fr2wswn,TRUE,t3_gmcrnb,/r/newzealand/comments/gmcrnb/as_an_american_who_might_want_to_move_out_of_the/fr2wswn/,1,gmcrnb,newzealand,t5_2qhma,0,1,2020-05-18T23:43:47Z

AutoModerator,t2_6l4z3,FALSE,TRUE,"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

Anglicanpolitics123,t2_43z74oz9,FALSE,FALSE,"Well I guess that's a matter of perspective. The war narratives contain a lot of themes that I think is still relevant. 

(i)Theme of liberation

The idea that an oppressed people can fight for their liberation against an oppressive power is something that's still important in our day. You see this particularly in the Book of Judges with various judges like Deborah and Gideon fighting against occupying powers and invaders like the Canaanites, Midianites and Amalekites. 

(ii)Destroying wickedness. 

In the war narratives you see the theme of ""the ban"". And English translation of the ""herem"" which can either mean ""devoted to destruction"" or ""prohibited"". So in the conquest passages war is fought. Why? To purge the land of the wicked practise of human sacrifice which was taking place. In 1 Samuel 15(which i said is hyperbolic keep in mind) the ""ban"" is placed on Amalek. Why? Because Amalek showed hostilitiy and xenophobia to the Israelites when they were leaving Egypt as refugees by attacking them and killing their stragglers. This theme is pushed even harder in the text when Saul tells the Kenites to leave(1 Samuel 15:6). So the theme there is that a society that practises xenophobia and hostility to the outsider, particularly outsiders in need, is punished. A society that shows kindness to the outsider is spared.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874227,2020-05-18T23:43:47Z,NA,0,t1_fr2wt34,fr2wt34,FALSE,TRUE,t3_gm849s,t1_fr2wt34,TRUE,t1_fr2vmei,/r/DebateReligion/comments/gm849s/old_testament_war_narratives_cant_understood/fr2wt34/,1,gm849s,DebateReligion,t5_2snuc,0,1,2020-05-18T23:43:49Z

DominusEgastus,t2_6b3hgegj,FALSE,FALSE,"I'm a 24/7 TPE Dom and in my opinion the most important personality trait for a Dom is self control.

  
If you have a big scene planned that you are super excited about and something gets in the way(injury, tiredness, work e.t.c), you have to be willing to call it off or alter it.

If tension arises, subs are allowed to react emotionally, you can't,  You have to keep your eye on the prize, and always respond appropriately.  


Being able to take your beloved girlfriend, tie her up and fuck her face like she's a filthy porn start is amazing, there is nothing like it.  When you stop thrusting, and she eagerly thrusts her face down your shaft, moaning at how much she loves to please you, it's indescribable. Her proud smile the next day when you congratulate her on how hard and deep she can take it now is like the sun coming up. But that's the end result of a HUGE amount of hard work that requires the Dom to be in control of themselves at all times.  


So yeah to answer your question "" are submissive needs, on average, somehow more deep-running and essential to subs than dominant needs to doms?""

Second link shows bias against women exists, but doesn't show that bias against men doesn't exist to a greater extent.  


Third is your first actual example, well done. It's also a study for which there are counter examples.

  
Fourth is another example, however, it is countered by the example I posted.

  
Fifth doesn't demonstrate all that much. It simply suggests that there is a discrepancy in perception between men and women for how relevant particular research is.

&#x200B;

Sixth doesn't demonstrate discrimination against women. It could demonstrate positive stereotypes about Asians.

&#x200B;

Seventh demonstrates that mens hiring practices are more influenced than womens by priming, but doesn't examine what the actual environment is or how it primes them. As such it doesn't demonstrate a discrimination against women in STEM. It demonstrates that discrimination against women in STEM would exist if STEM environments were primed the way the study primes participants.

&#x200B;

As for your ""New study"" point, it demonstrates that this affirmative action is beyond addressing a discrimination that may or may not exist.

People are imperfect. We all are. We do and say things that are not right. You won't find any type of community with perfect people. Hence, judging a religion based on whether its current leader is perfect isn't enough.

The fact is that the doctrine of Catholicism itself *does* claim it is the one true religion, regardless of what any of its members say. The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a good source for its doctrine. [CCC 846](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P29.HTM) (emphasis mine):

>Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that **the Church**, a pilgrim now on earth, **is necessary for salvation**: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874240,2020-05-18T23:44:00Z,NA,0,t1_fr2wtvo,fr2wtvo,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gmacsj,t1_fr2wtvo,TRUE,t1_fr2qwnm,/r/Catholicism/comments/gmacsj/thinking_about_catholicism_but/fr2wtvo/,1,gmacsj,Catholicism,t5_2qi4f,0,1,2020-05-18T23:44:02Z

Avenger's Mansion isn't even playable in the same turn as this because your hand-size is 5 unless you draw 2 double resources too (at which point, the avenger's mansion draw probably does nothing for you).  Helicarrier isn't even playable unless you draw a double resource.  No upgrade/support over 2 is playable without a double resource.

You aren't going to sit in Banner form into turn 2.  You just aren't (or at least, I hope you aren't I guess).  That instantly turns off the 2-resource investment you played turn 1 until they finally chew through 3 defense and shy of 18ish HP when you flip back to heal (or draw your obligation).

Any turn you may play this after that when you're Hulk, you only look to play this if you're actually going into alter-ego that same turn.  You have a 4-hand size, you're not spending 2 resources and a card on something that literally will do nothing without flipping.

But the stars align, you need to heal and draw this.  You pay your 2-resources and card flip to alter ego and get that sweet downtime bonus heal.  Do you still have something to spend that mental resource on (keep in mind, your hand-size was 4)?  Maybe, maybe not.

Werner Von Braun would be a genius regardless of the rise of Nazis. Nikola Tesla is the forfather of modern electricity and never in his life (as I am aware, his contributions were valuable after his involvment in pushing the envelope to even envision them, in his life they were hardly the skeleton of what they would become) succeeded in pitching the US military on things like remote controlled devices. The cruel societies of the past may have survived but that's not why their contributions are worth holding on to. Societal development and violence are not intrinsically linked.  Violence is 900% necessary to hold them against outside aggression, but absolving the monsters of our past is the wrong move.

The issue with Oda Nobunaga was he was aware of his own history with his own issues with his siblings so wanted no such thing for his heir. He thus went out of his way to make sure his other children were adopted out of the clan into other clans. Nobutaka is actually Kanbe Nobutaka, and Nobutaksu is actually *北畠信意*  \[ I have no clue the Romanji for this\]. They couldn't fill their brother's and father's shoes because they were intentionally brought up that way. To not be an issue for Nobunaga's heir. In fact, Nobunaga went out of his way to make sure his own borthers wouldn't be a problem.

Why not tell the ones you aren't interested in that you aren't, or unmatch them outright? Seems like you would have a whole lot less folks to juggle if you just cleared out the no's. I know when I have more than three conversations going at any given time, it becomes exhausting and usually someone gets left out unintentionally. The fallacy of choice ultimately leaves us very picky and incredibly indecisive at the same time and dating apps really promote that.

Ghosting happens but it can be really hard to tell the difference between ""busy with work and life"" and ""really not feeling you, dude""

As much as bumble's 24 hour timer sucks, it does have a very real purpose.

Now, X goes up, so you get 110=100. For every unit of output, you have 1.1 units of money, so 1.1 units of money buy 1 unit of output. That's inflation.

If you get a rise in both, so let's say 100=100 goes to 120=120, every unit of money can still buy one unit of output. You don't get inflation.

> 
>   
>   
>  En mi insomnio, contemplo cómo la Biblioteca Covid crece como hongos entre las tumbas, una hiedra de voces que se expanden como pulpos secos. Nuestros clics entrenan la narrativa, que de a poco va encontrando su forma: en el Netflix de los relatos mediáticos, el Capitalismo es el villano que les gusta a los intelectuales. Leo a Olga Tokarczuk, Nobel de Literatura 2019: “Ante nuestros ojos se desvanece como el humo el paradigma civilizatorio que nos ha formado en los últimos doscientos años: que somos dueños de la creación, que lo podemos todo”. Es una conclusión extraña: el paradigma de los últimos dos siglos es el de la ciencia sistemática, que permite que identifiquemos partículas ínfimas, aliviemos el dolor e impidamos muchas más muertes que nuestros (pobres) antepasados bubónicos diezmados por pestes previas.
> 
> Occidente se narra sus propios mitos de poderío y destrucción. El paradigma civilizatorio del que habla Olga se inserta en una narrativa predilecta: la desmesura humana que quería crecer, expandirse, saberlo todo, y de pronto le llega su merecido en forma de mini-ser, de virus –algo vulgar, banal, infrahumano–. El hombre sigue siendo el centro del mundo en este esquema, el hacedor oculto de su propio castigo. La calamidad de la naturaleza se reabsorbe en paranoia y soberbia antropocéntrica. Porque ¿qué tiene qué hacer la Naturaleza más que girar alrededor del Hombre?
> 
> Es de madrugada, los rayos cancerígenos del sol asoman débiles. De a poco, me dejo infectar por la premisa del capitalismo villano, la siento hundirse en mi sistema. La pandemia pegó más fuerte porque el capitalismo había infectado mucho más de lo que se piensa. El capitalismo estaba en un auge especial porque vivía incluso entre portadores “asintomáticos” pero contagiados igual, que expandían el virus con fuerza. El feminismo verde es el primer contagiado sin saberlo.
> 
> La peste llega justo cuando acariciábamos el fin del dolor. A ese nivel de control había llegado a soñar el paradigma civilizatorio del que habla Tokarczuk. “Si duele no es amor” no buscaba solo evitar los maltratos físicos, sino que se extendió sobre el amor en su proyecto sanitario. Sometió las relaciones amorosas a un exigente control de calidad. Las relaciones amorosas y los compañeros sexuales se clasificaban según criterios de consumo: detectar lo “tóxico” para su descarte. La experiencia del amor debe ser satisfactoria y conducente a mayor productividad. El amor como el fitness: algo que te hace bien y te ayuda a estar bien. La dimensión humana del dolor se controla en términos de su consumo, perfilando el cuerpo para su máxima productividad.
> 
> La fantasía sanitarista del último feminismo puso las relaciones amorosas y sexuales bajo estrictos protocolos de uso, unidos a la promesa del bienestar total. ¿Pero puede alguien enamorarse sin un horizonte de dolor y de pérdida? Buscó suprimir la fricción del desencuentro, del malentendido: el mandato del último feminismo es que todo fluya como el flujo del capital, de la transacción comercial, donde no hay peligro, donde pago por lo que obtengo, y si no, lo devuelvo. El capitalismo desde el punto de vista del consumidor (no del inversor, donde sí hay riesgo). El amor como una empresa responsable hacia sus clientes.
> 
> Las nuevas sensibilidades feministas no suelen reconocer sus deudas con el capitalismo neoliberal. A pesar de sus consignas psicobolches, el último feminismo encuentra su estructura sentimental formada íntegramente por él –llegando a acelerarlo–. El feminismo como cabeza del paradigma civilizatorio consumidor: creía que podía domesticar el dolor, pero llega el virus y, con él, la certeza: no se puede exiliar el dolor de la Nueva Polis purificada.
> 
> La narrativa funciona mejor cuando los buenos son los auténticos malos, los malos que lo son sin saberlo. El feminismo verde era el capitalismo por otros medios. Pero quizás ya me dormí y estoy soñando. La raza se extingue, y un Herodoto marciano observa las últimas imágenes del mundo pre-Covid. Multitudes vestidas de verde dólar, el color del virus del capital par excellence.

OrionTheFree,t2_41bri2dg,FALSE,FALSE,"While I don't personally know of any online resources, it doesn't mean there aren't any! I'm sure someone somewhere has to have done something with it at some point.

My first hot tip would probably be to sit down with your players and determine exactly what kind of game you want to run. Are you helping an Avatar? Are you members of a specific nation? If so what is your goal? Also do you want it to take place in a particular place in established lore, or somewhere new?

Also you'll have to figure out if DnD is the right system for this- I'm sure it would be fine but you'll probably have to restrict the class/subclass list as I feel like some abilities don't translate to ATLA (personally, its your call though!).

There are some homebrew classes I've seen that you could probably put to good use!

I'll have to dig around and find links but right now I know there are homebrews (somewhere) for a Water-based Warlock subclass, an Air based Monk subclass (Way of the Swift Winds I think), and a Pyromancy subclass for the Wizard.

Additionally depending on how many beasts you plan on encountering but you'll have to stat those out and that's always a daunting task- you can always just rip statblocks from existing creatures and rename them though!

Also unless you discover something really unbalanced during play I wouldn't be super concerned with balance- especially considering the world you'll be playing in, just worry about what's fun for everyone!

Andy called Jim plenty of cheesy nicknames. Except Jim never asked Andy to stop calling him big tuna. Huge difference. Andy very politely asks Jim to call him Drew, Jim basically just smirks and says fuck no.

However, if you trust Biden as little as I do and as little as you say you do then do you really think you could trust any concessions he’d make.

I totally get the anger against Bernie, but I just have to appreciate what he did for the progressive movement. People I know who were apolitical became involved back in 2016 when he jumped into the race. He energized a movement that has unfortunately lost the battle, but I think is on the right side of history. 

I get that feeling. I can at least respect the decision to vote Green over a non-vote or a vote for an Independent, but I don’t think people should feel so morally attached to their vote. We didn’t choose this two-party, first to the post system. We’re just living in it. It’s impossible to stick to moral votes all the time in a system like the one we have now. Regardless of everything else it makes me really sad that you’d feel so guilty about using your vote for a pragmatic but unethical candidate. I hope we can move toward a ranked choice voting system and a parliamentary system some day so people don’t HAVE to abandon their morals in order to effectively use their vote.

dyskgo,t2_99dhx,FALSE,FALSE,"**WAKE** by /u/AstroSlop

This was an interesting script for me to read, because I had already read the first 30 or so pages beforehand, and didn't really have a clue what to make of it or where it was going. I'm usually able to get a good read on the general vibe of a script/film and my own thoughts on it within the first 30 minutes, but this is one of the only times where I had absolutely *nothing* to say. You asked for feedback and I couldn't give you anything, because I had no clue where you were taking it or what it even was. 

Now, having read *WAKE*, I can see your vision. I've seen a couple people mention that the ending left them with questions, and while I obviously did have lingering questions given how surreal and unconventional this script was, the ending is really where everything came together for me. I *got* it...or, at least got enough of the story as one can reasonably be expected to, given the surreal nature. This is an amazingly surreal, original, and imaginative work, but most importantly, like all of your works, its heartfelt. 

**PROS**

- I don't know if I've pointed this out before or if I even realized it myself, but one of the things that makes your writing so strong is your ability to create these compelling and powerful visuals that cut right through to the reader's core through pure force of their imagination and potency. It's been a feature through all of your work: the victim being torn apart mid-air in *Home*, the dummies on the plane in *Naegi*, the pew expanding like lungs in *Miranda Chamlee*, the chaotic stripclub meelee in *Submerged*. Here, once again, the visuals that you have conjured are so compelling, I find myself thinking about them days later. They stand out in my mind. Film is a visual medium, and I think that you've mastered the art of crafting mesmerizing visuals. What makes these visuals so effective is that they're loaded with emotion and thematic relevance. Specifically, the dream sequences, the soldiers' eyes leaking black tears, the mountains collapsing as they drive through, and the encroaching darkness all stood out. 

- It's been mentioned before but the highway chase sequence is an astounding set-piece, up there with the strip-club melee from *Submerged*. I'd be hard-pressed to choose between them. From the second the sedans come into view, it's full-throttle, unrelenting, stunning onslaught of action that doesn't let down. What I enjoy most about these scenes when you create them (as in *Submerged) is that they're completely dynamic; you're constantly throwing in new twists and turns, building the stakes, and spiraling up the conflict into new, unseen avenues. It's masterful action writing and completely invigorating. 

- From start to finish, *WAKE* is entirely its own thing. The number one thing that I look for in any script or film is originality, and this script has it in spades. We live in a time where there are a lot of films and screenplays that are content to bank on nostalgia and retreading what's already been done, but you present something completely your own here. The imagination on display is refreshing. 

- What makes your work so strong is that it's always truly heartfelt and there's always a purpose, a reason, for it to exist. You don't write frivolities; you write about what truly matters to you. That's what makes your writing so engrossing. With *WAKE*, you have something to say, and that's what makes this script truly interesting beyond all the action, bloodshed, and trippy elements. 

- I enjoyed the dynamic between the characters. Despite the depressing and violent nature of the subject matters, there's a real tenderness and loving between Butcher, Dreamer, Actor and Occultist. This extends even, as revealed later on, to the seemingly villainous Father. It's this underlying tenderness in the script that really makes it moving and comforting. You're able to balance dark subject matter with a levity and lack of cynicism, which is something that's sorely missing from many recent works. 

- The ending was my favourite part of the script, because that's where I finally began to piece together some of the story and see what you were getting at underneath, and it was really quite touching and moving. The whole script took on another resonance for me. It comes from a place of deep emotion, and even if we can't piece together all of the thematic elements completely perfectly, those emotions come through to the reader. Foremost, this is a deeply personal piece, and you convey your own experiences and feelings of writing and personal demons in a brilliant way. I can see why you considered this script a swansong of sorts, conveying all that you have to say. 

**CONS**

- This is a personal dislike of mine, but I've always really ascribed to ""lesser is more"" and I become taken out of works when they're too extravagant. I know many other people disagree, but when there's too many elements, I become overwhelmed and disconnected. That happened for me with the ending battle; there were golems, hordes of beasts, pillars descending from the sky, beams of colored light, gigantic eggs, and I got lost in it. I do think the extravagance tied in to what you were going for thematically on some level, but I have a hard time envisioning it working on screen in a compelling way. 

- I felt like the characters were somewhat vague and underdeveloped at times. I can see this being a stylistic choice, because not only is the script surreal but it operates largely as a metaphor (with the characters themselves being given archetypal monikers and existing ). That being said, I felt like the main quadrant of characters could speak and behave a little too similarly. Actor and Occultist, in particular, came across as very similar to me, outside of their respective powers. 

- I think the one piece of advice that I did give you on the first 30 pages was that it felt so surreal that it was hard to become invested in the characters, because you don't know what the stakes are in the story or who these characters truly are. Having finished the script, I still feel like that was an issue for me, especially earlier on. I think there's a way to keep all the surreal elements while also grounding the narrative with some clearer details, even if they're solely there to hook the reader early on.

Overall, *WAKE* was probably your most original and imaginative work yet, which is saying a lot given what you've already accomplished with your work. While I hope to read more from you to come, I can see how you put everything into this one, and it really paid off. Your most surreal and crazy script ended up being the one that connected with people the most, but it's also because it's one of the most heartfelt.

ScrotoFaggins,t2_iw4ox,FALSE,FALSE,"Yes. The timeline of my break-up and NC experience has been as follows:

* August 2019 - broke up with him due to not feeling loved, wanted, and appreciated. He didn't take it well, but made no attempt to stop me. Started NC.

* November 2019 - he messages me in the middle of the night saying he misses me and hopes I'm well. I cave and think he's changed. After a week, realize I'm still being made to feel worthless, tell him that this will be my last message to him and to never contact me again. Start NC again.

* Last Tuesday, May 2020 - he messages me again at 4 AM saying he misses me and that he hopes I'm doing well. At this point, I've stopped caring and casually respond saying I'm doing well. All week he sends me pictures and tells me he wants to see me (convenient, given that we can't travel bcs of quarantine) and cook for me, and I feel absolutely nothing. No hope that he's changed, no desire to see him change. Basically, I am completely over someone I thought I'd love forever.

I'm glad he reached out, as he was someone I thought would be a part of my future, and I didn't want the negative emotions near the end to eclipse the good times we had.

TheTalkingMeowth,t2_v9k78,FALSE,FALSE,"This is a very WWW twist on a classic game theory problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicidal_chauffeur_problem

The key to the game theory problem is relative maneuverability. If the vehicle's turning radius is too large, the evader can survive indefinitely.

The real problem is more complicated, since the car's turning radius depends on its speed and the evader can get tired. It also has the option of attacking back: in effect, a collision between evader and vehicle is NOT a guaranteed victory for the vehicle (which is the premise of the game theory problem).

Still, the recognition that maneuverability is key is useful. As another user pointed out, the civic needs to hit the gorilla head on at fairly high speed; if the gorilla were to wait near a wall, allow the civic to charge, then dive out of the way things would go poorly for the driver.

✅To make the dough, mix flour & salt in a large bowl until well combined. Make a well in the middle & pour in hot water. Using a spatula, fold in all flour until a shaggy dough forms with no dry spots of flour in the bowl (if it does, add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time). Transfer flour to a cleaned surface & knead until a smooth dough forms, about 10mins. Cover with a damp towel & rest for 30 mins.⁣
✅Meanwhile, place tofu in a cheesecloth bag & wring out all the liquid. Saute chopped green beans with 1 teaspoon oil in a pan for about 1-2 mins. Add green beans into a bowl along with tofu, carrot & seasoning ingredients. Mix well & divide the mixture into 10 portions & form it into a patty-like shape.⁣
✅When ready, dust flour on the surface, roll dough into a log & divide into 10 equal balls.⁣
✅To assemble, take one dough, flatten it with your palm & roll into a wrapper, about 4.5 inches diameter by keeping the middle part thicker Place one filling patty in the middle & pleat to seal. Dab the smooth side with water then gently press in some sesame seeds.⁣
✅To cook the buns (baked/pan-fried), see comments section👇🏻...⁣ 📝Note: To measure flour in the cup, I used the spoon & sweep method.

Wiscmax34,t2_12xwrl,FALSE,FALSE,"Im a 26 year of male- 6 ft, 230lbs. 

In June of 2019, I began developing a number of troubling symptoms- it began with a severe caffeine intolerance- caffeine would trigger severe pressure headaches, vision problems, dizziness. I had been a heavy caffeine user for many years- never had issues except for jitteriness or anxiety using caffeine heavily. I cut back on caffeine, but the symptoms grew in number and got worse with time.

I soon began to develop sleep arousals/ focal seizures (undiagnosed) that manifest as choking dreams/ coughing and acting out pulling item out of my throat. As I noted in my other document, these have gotten progressively worse and not improved at all since last June. They are often made worse by exercise and fatigue. 

As fall 2019 came, around August/ September, I began noticing severe fatigue/ heaviness when running. I had been running daily at this point for a year. 3-6 miles would be normal. I’d make it about a mile, feel so heavy that I’d have to quit and go back home. Keep in mind that I lost 80 pounds in a year intentionally. 

Next came the head pressure that was triggered by running or any exercise. This still persists so severely that I have been unable to even walk briskly without symptoms incapacitating me. I have, since December, gained nearly 20 pounds. The weight has increased steadily. My diet hasn’t been the best it’s ever been, but the calories are never exceedingly high. I wouldn’t say ive been eating clean though. 

Things then escalated beyond my comfort level around September- I began to feel severe memory issues. For example, I was in a carpool to work each morning- I began losing place of my car- I couldn’t remember where I parked or whether I had even driven- then it would be little things like whether I took my meds or heck, even if I just shampooed my hair. I’d walk in to a room and forget why I was there. It really started to freak me out when I wouldn’t remember talking about certain things with my girlfriend- she would say that I just asked that question or said that thing and I wouldn’t remember it! I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING MY MIND... or developing dementia!

It wasn’t until I attended a Brewer game with a friend that I decided to seek medical attention. When I went to this brewer game, I felt off the whole day, then when I got to the game, I felt like I had a stroke. My vision became SUPER static-y/ blurry/ tunnel vision- I couldn’t think, couldn’t recognize my surroundings, was SUPER sensitive to sound and light, and barely made it home. This set off a cascade of symptoms that I couldn’t explain-
Soon, my eyes were FILLED with floaters of all size- some tiny, some worm shaped, some dark- but a load of floaters filled my vision within a week or so and still persist. I saw an eye doctor in January 2020, and nothing appeared odd to him, so he dismissed me.  My vision continued to worsen- my vision would become blurry or darken in my left eye when exercising. I’d also notice that my eyes struggled to track movement when driving- I was driving on the weekends to see my now fiancé and would be scared to drive, as lights and movement really set off my symptoms. 

I saw my GP, explained the severity of symptoms- he ordered an MRI of the brain and some random blood work- all came back normal so he dismissed as anxiety and stress- I tried to toughen up and move on… But things got worse.

I’d also have to say that I was sick all the time- I had maybe 2-3 colds/ flu from Oct- January- In December, I travelled to see my brother in Florida and was hit by a very bad stomach bug- I spent the entire weekend in the bathroom. 

Then, January came and HIT ME HARD- I can still remember waking up on January 4th and knowing something was very WRONG.
I began to wake up SEVERELY dizzy/ lightheaded every morning, combined with severe tinnitus, light sensitivity and what I called “lazy speech”, a sensation that I couldn’t work my tongue and lips with the same strength that I always had been able to. These were also paired with a stiff neck that grew in stiffness and creaks and cracks like the bones are grinding together. The dizziness, tinnitus and light and sound sensitivity, and neck issues are still very bad all day.

It was at this time that I began a new job and was having a terrible time managing my symptoms- often made unbearable by the lighting in my workplace and the increased screen time- something I never had an issue with until now. But these symptoms were not just fatigued eyes or excess screen time.

I soon noticed the memory issues coming back- Id forget words, procedures, names, places, my way home and once even forgot how to respond to a 4 way stopping intersection. It was as If I forgot how to drive…

I made an appointment with my new GP-she ordered blood work, sent me to a Neurologist and Sleep physician. I was given a series of blood tests and an in lab sleep study, all of which came back “normal”. They refused to take another look at my brain or treat- any further. No explanation for severe, laundry list of symptoms, no concern for my sleep episodes. 

New, worsening symptoms continued to develop- on top of my sleep arousals/ seizure like activity, I would develop stroke like sensations while sleeping- would wake up and feel half my face paralyzed, vision in right eye was blurred, and I’d feel incredibly disoriented. It was a frightening sensation. 

I then developed a week or so of of heart palpitations that would last a few seconds and come and go every 30 seconds or so. Thankfully, they eventually went away.

I hit a new low when I attempted a short 1 mile jog in April- my head pressure grew, vision worsened, grew disoriented- came home, my body tingled with internal tremors for hours, light show in eyes got worse, went to bed, woke up with shooting pains and muscle cramping down my arms and a pounding heart. I had enough- I went to the ER, scared to death. They kept me for a few hours, EKG and blood work run- no heart attack and no diagnosable cause for the episode. I was short on sleep and high on symptoms- pain and anxiety. 

I returned to the ER that morning with the worst malaise I’ve felt and an inability to sleep. Burning sensation and pain in my head, neck and limbs, immense weakness and air hunger, among all the other visual, auditory and neuro symptoms. I felt like I was dying. I asked to be admitted, they couldn’t find reason to admit me, as my vitals were normal and blood tests were normal. BUT THIS WAS NOT NORMAL- they dismissed me. Unable to just accept my symptoms as normal anxiety or stress, I fought for treatment- sought an MRI of brain and cervical neck.

medspirational,t2_4llf84t1,FALSE,FALSE,"Are you serious?
You are confused or what. Sex slavery is forbidden.
You seem some teenager , ok let me explain again this .
What you mention and you think of child marriage and blaming onto a religion is based completed on prejudice or some kind of reactionary and rebellious kind of mindset.( Don't know but it can be a possibility you are victim of abuse or some bad treatment). Yes Muslim parents can be monster too because it's human nature irrespective of any religion.Infact religion came to keep these humans in harmony. 
     Now if we assume, you have no bad family history .Then I would must say you are really bad in history ,geography or never read anthropology.
Now how we differentiate between a person he/she is ready for sex.Science has differwnt cut off like 14-16, by constitution in different states it's 18, 16  etc. Now what you are referring to is that centuries ago , people just settle the marriage of kids , it still do in Jews ,christians ,Muslims ,atheists like in Royal families they were pre planned and even cermonaized in childhood( attention just marriage not sex ).
Even then at those time the marriage was consumated after reaching puberty.

So I'd again request , please dont be so blindfolded and trying see the facts ,history with open heart.if you see everything with hate , reactionary you will not be able to visualize the right path.

Sully5443,t2_ps6iq,FALSE,FALSE,"As is often the case, ""it depends"" is the answer. As per usual, look to the fiction.

When looking at this example, a couple of questions come to mind:

* So a group Hunt to resolve a gunfight would, ostensibly, mean that the PCs were ""shooting precisely from some distance""
   * How many PCs were doing this?
   * How far away were they? What ""distance"" are we talking about?
   * *Why* were they doing this? Why did the NPC need to die? What purpose did that NPC's death serve the PCs' intent?
   * To what extent can the NPC react?

When setting the Position and Effect, *ideally* it helps to use the Position and Effect as ""shorthand"" *terms* to denote ""what is on the table""

* Rather than saying: ""Hmm.. Risky/ Standard by the sound of it"" (which is fine, mind you); it would be *better* to say:
   * ""Well this is Risky because we aren't really on anyone's terms here. I'm seeing a likelihood for an escalation of violence moving you into a Desperate Position, perhaps even impairing your Effect. However, I think you'll most certainly clear at least *one* of them with Standard- but *both* when they already have their guns drawn? Unlikely. Sound fair?""
      * This process should assist in ""talking through"" the whole ""what is going to happen next?"" procedure. It will *also* help you realize- in some circumstances, ""Hey, wait a second... I can't think of any good or reasonable consequences here! This probably *isn't* an Action Roll- I think we just need to hone in on the fiction and *maybe* use a Fortune Roll if indicated!""

To *me*, 2 or more PCs ""Hunting from a Distance"" (of course, ""distance"" is vague for a reason!) to shoot this singular armed NPC with some degree precision seems to be *really* Controlled to the point that I even question if the NPC can do very much about this situation. This *might* be a situation where they just ""do the thing"" with no roll required. The outcome is, in a sense, ""obvious."" From there, I will follow the fiction accordingly and participate in the conversation at the table with my GM Actions in accordance to the GM Framework.

Now, let's say- for argument's sake- that an Action Roll *is* called for, well... again, follow the fiction! Sometimes the consequences (one way or another) fall on the whole group. Sometimes it may only sensibly affect one or a few people in the group. It all depends on the fiction.

To *me*, it sounds pretty reasonable that a singular armed NPC can only return harm to a singular involved PC. In a sense, this is a consequence for *everyone* ""no matter what"" because their Crew-Mate has lost available resources which may hamper the rest of the Crew.

Anyway, that'd be *my* 2 Cents.

DeadFyre,t2_n123w,FALSE,FALSE,"Streletsy get +110% health and +115% damage from upgrades, and a further 35% damage and 45% health from Shipments (Strelet Combat, Boyars, Strelet Horde). If you build them from a fort, they get 90 health and 10 damage, only 72 and 8 if they're built at a blockhouse. So their maximum stats are:

229.5 health, 25 damage, and x3 damage vs heavy infantry.

They've got 30% ranged resistance, range 14, and cost 76 villager-seconds.

Grenadiers get +110% health and damage from upgrades, plus +1 aoe and extra siege damage from Incendiary Grenades. They also benefit from the Ransack Shipment. So, their maximum stats are:

420 health, 33.6 damage with AoE4.

They've got 50% ranged resistance, range 12, and cost 279 villager-seconds. They also do half damage to cavalry and light infantry (read: Eagle Warriors).

So, are they worth using? Well, against a musketeer mob, your 2 strelets are going to be doing 150 damage at range 14 where the Grenadiers are doing 33 and a half damage to guys in a wide area. Strelets also take more damage from AoE attacks themselves, and tend to wither in the face of artillery, though Grens are also infantry, and will only fare slightly better.

Given that Westernization and Peterine Reforms give you the upgrades to both types of units, I like to mix both into my predominantly muskteeer horde. Where some streletsy will sit back behind my muskets a bit and add echelon firepower, the grens will mingle up close, soak up lots of musket fire, and soften up lots of troops to be picked off by the rest of my army.

But the biggest advantage of adding a handful of grenadiers to your musket mob is that they **demand** attention, because they can demolish towns so quickly. With Ransack, 2 strelets will do 24 damage each to buildings. One grenadier fully upgraded with Ransack will do 157 damage do buildings, and still inflict AoE damage to any nearby troops in the vicinity. This is siege damage that puts horse artillery to shame (the closest runner-up in the Russian arsenal). One of those does 437.5 damage every 4 seconds, for three times the population cost. So, normalized for population and time, you've got 26.2 damage per population per second for grens, and 18.2 damage per population per second for horse artillery.

SubsistanceMortgage,t2_3ddowklx,FALSE,FALSE,"You’re going to get some people coming here telling you to follow your dreams, do what you want to do, that you can be just as successful not doing public, etc. Don’t listen to them.

Yes, Big 4/public is not the only option for starting an accounting career. It is still by far the best option. There are people with one year of experience at one of the B4 from 20 years ago who still find a way to make it into the first sentence of their cover letters and professional biographies. It matters and will set you up for long term success in accounting/financial professions even if you don’t want to make partner or otherwise be a lifer.

There is a reason why B4 and public are still so attractive despite their well-known reputations as sweat shops: they offer you a better life long-term and most people make the calculation that the short-term trade off is worth it. If it wasn’t, people wouldn’t keep accepting the offers.

This is not because of kool-aid, marketing, or propaganda (though those do help fill hiring quotas.) This is because people actually see a meaningful long-term impact in the lives of others they know and want that impact on their own lives. You can’t mass dupe a 200,000+ workers who have other options into working for you if there wasn’t something in it for them.

-Severe, bone deep -chronic fatigue, especially when doing normal activities that wouldn’t have pushed me into fatigue- basic chores, work, etc.

-shortness of breath when fatigued

-sensation of burning in nerves- down neck and into arms and legs (comes and goes- though much worse when I do too much)

-vision changes (increased visual static- like seeing the world through a static tv filter; increased floaters over the last three months, a blinking sensation- as if my vision is rapidly blinking; difficulty coordinating eyes when fatigued; closed eye/dark room retinal activity- as if a light show is going on- very disturbing most nights)

-Raynaud's- severe cold in hands and feet that comes with discoloration- 

-Memory issues- would frequently forget where I parked at work, losing track of normal things

-Mood changes

-Severe anxiety/ depression

-Bizarre nightmares/ fragmented dreams

-palpitations- especially while sleeping- Waking with heart beating out of chest, palpitations occasionally during the day.

HorsinAround1996,t2_1edwqxij,FALSE,FALSE,"I suppose it’s up to interpretation, but every statement after the first sentence was stated as fact not opinion. 

As far as recovery, and again, I’m in no way qualified to diagnose this man. I don’t think it’s a given his life would be a sad existence. If he, theoretically, suffered from schizophrenia, with coexisting addiction to methamphetamine, with years of heavy use and underlying depression/anxiety, this could still be treatable. Yes his dopamine system would be in a terrible state, he’d need prolonged abstinence where the brain would produce very little dopamine resulting in likely severe depression, but over time his brain would slowly upregulate dopamine production, although to what degree is impossible to say. His mental illness could be treated with medication and therapy, as a plus the meds should increase his dopamine. Meth is a tough one to get off because there’s no medicine designed to ween users off like opioids and alcohol(although some research has looked at dexamphetamine), however strictly administered benzodiazepines could take the edge of the initial cravings. With this treatment there’s a chance he could live a decent life.

Again, this is a theoretical situation, but my point is we should never write people off as too far gone. I understand they make others uncomfortable, which they have no right to do and if their actions against others become criminal they should be punished accordingly. I just feel society needs to show a bit more empathy for these people though, no one wakes up one day and decides hey I think I’ll descend into madness today, there’s always an underlying cause that’s usually outside of their control. 

Euthanasia for those who are certifiably “too far gone” and living an awful existence with no chance of it getting better, for me, is a moral dilemma.

Revhan,t2_14b2u0,FALSE,FALSE,"Honestly in a philosophy thread this comment could be read even as trolling, there is a platitude of problems regarding knowledge and certainty that apply even to the allegedly hard sciences, so let's be practical a let them be scientists and have their fun.

VeggieBasedLifeform,t2_415pkldg,FALSE,FALSE,"Hi, my monitor recently got a purple-ish tone on the left side, and it has like lines between the pixels that doesn't show up on the right side (that looks like it has some greenish tone, but could be because of the contrast with the left side), the right is also getting some burn in when there is something white for a long time on the left side of the screen. On the lower part, the last 20 or so lines of pixel are repeating the top part with some blue lines on the middle, this happen intermittently and goes back to ""normal"" after a while. I want to buy a replacement but I don't know if it is the screen, the flat cable or the board.

It looked like a cable problem, but now that I noticed the burn in, it is difficult to know.

Some [photos](https://imgur.com/a/gJZ9i25) of the problem, it is difficult to get it on camera, but if you zoom in you can see the lines and the different tone (the rainbow effect is because of the camera, I don't actually see it).

It's kind of sad saying that, but it really was. I was extremely fed up how he would just stop trying (happened multiple times before the marriage) and would threaten to break up, so one day when he invited me over I told him we should divorce and oh my, this man started crying. I was surprised, but I felt like it wasn't because he was going to miss me as a person, rather just because... someone was going to leave him again.

g0ldent0y,t2_9oqm4,FALSE,FALSE,"Its cloth simulation. Thats why there is the T_Pose to Run animation at the start to ease in the simulated cloth.

Basically you have a base shape you animate via bones, then you model some cloth (like the skirt) around the base model. Make sure, your clothes dont intersect with the base model (very imporant, because it can break the simulation if a simulated vertice gets trapped inside a collision object), and then activate the cloth simulation in the physics tab. Activate soft body/cloth collision on your base model in the physics tab as well. Make sure to set the collision distances pretty low (i have it on the lowest settings both in the collision object and the clothes).

To get the right settings, its a lot of tinkering and trial and error. Which is pretty time consuming since baking the cloth simulation can get quite excessive. And stressing the CPU while baking can cause the simulation to break (so no watching videos in the mean time). So be careful not to overdo the amount of vertices you let blender simulate.

There is a lot more you can do with vertex groups like defining different cloth stiffness settings for different parts of the cloth, or pinning down vertices inside the cloth so you can have those animated via bones (like i did for the collar thing).

If you have issues with the collision (like vertices get trapped inside collision objects despite them not intersecting at the beginning of the simulation), bump up the simulation steps and collision quality in the cloths settings. But again, be careful. Its a time eater.

Its quite an excessive area, and not always very easy to understand right away.

The  most recent offender is a preprint claiming that SARS-CoV-2 with an   amino acid change in the spike glycoprotein (D614G) increases the   transmissibility of the virus. The claim that this amino acid change   increases viral transmission is unsubstantiated and likely incorrect.   There is no doubt that viruses with the D614G change are emerging in   different geographical regions of the world. Until proven otherwise,   their emergence is likely due to the founder effect. Let’s say a virus   with D614G emerges during replication in a person’s respiratory tract.   If viruses with that change infect the next person, and the next, and so   on, then the D614G change will predominate. The change is simply a   single nucleotide polymorphism of little consequence. It is the noise   produced by error-prone RNA synthesis by the virus. Viruses with D614S   are simply virus isolates. They are not strains of SARS-CoV-2.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874416,2020-05-18T23:46:56Z,NA,0,t1_fr2x5g8,fr2x5g8,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gm1x7s,t1_fr2x5g8,TRUE,t1_fr2u314,/r/COVID19/comments/gm1x7s/weekly_question_thread_week_of_may_18/fr2x5g8/,1,gm1x7s,COVID19,t5_2f4l19,0,1,2020-05-18T23:46:58Z

ConsistentMethod1,t2_63m7v6yb,FALSE,FALSE,"> Not necessarily. If someone young migrates to Canada, and earns less than the average wage (as young people tend to do), than this number increases. But is anyone made worse off by this? No. 

I agree nobody is really hurt by that scenario.   


>Increased wages without a corresponding increase in production does not lead to a higher standard of living. If we have 100 widgets each, and your number of widgets increases to 150, but the total number remains the same, has our standard of living increased? No, because the only way this can happen is if I lose 50.  
>  
>You're mixing up cause and effect: increasing wages doesn't increase productivity, but rather increasing productivity increases wages.

Economists only believe that productivity is an indicator of standard of living because productivity is a proxy for average annual growth in the inflation-adjusted income of individuals. This is no longer the case.   


Productivity only measures how efficiently a company can output finished goods in relation to the labour hours required to make them. The profits from increased productivity are used at the discretion of individual companies. Increasingly, they are used for share buybacks and shareholder dividends. Rather than increased employee wages.   


[This study notes the disconnect between productivity and standard of living](http://csls.ca/reports/csls2008-8.pdf).    


With that said, I freely acknowledge that a 0 immigration scenario would not match the productivity gains of a 1% or existing immigration scenario. Let's rework your widget example to explain why I still advocate for it.  


Let's suppose the total amount of widgets in the economy is 100. Under the existing immigration scenario, I get 25, you get 25, your friend gets 25, and an immigrant gets 25. Let's say immigration is cut to 0, and productivity drops leading there to be only 85 widgets in the economy.   


In that respect, me, you and your friend now get 28.3 widgets, at the expense of the immigrant who is no longer a factor in the economy. This reflects the analysis of the original source that even with smaller GDP growth, GDP per person would increase, which is the objective.   


>At any rate, decreased wages for high earners is not necessarily a bad thing. Suppose the number of engineers doubled, and the average salary for one decreased by 12%. But this decrease in salary would lead to a decrease in the price of any product that relied heavily on engineers to create (eg cars). So everyone who buys a car (ie everybody else) would be made better off.

The problem isn't that immigration in Canada reduced income inequality, its *how* it did so. It accomplished this by stagnating the wages of higher earners. I'm not interested in stagnating the wages of anyone. I believe reducing inequality means bringing lower incomes *up*, not bringing higher incomes *down*.   


I see the point in your example regarding engineers. However, the only relationship between the salaries of labourers producing an item and the price it sells for is setting a minimum threshold to obtain a profit.   


Even if the number of engineers doubled and the value of their labour went down 12% there is no economic incentive for car manufacturers to reduce the price of their goods. They would simply absorb the extra 12% profit to allocate as they see fit.  
  

> Also, rather than relying on one study, let's look at some polls of economists:

Saying that because many economists believe something, so it must be true, is both an appeal to common belief, and appeal to authority fallacy. The best way to get the facts on the issue is to dive into the relevant data and come to a conclusion.  


>A demand side reduction would reduce our standard of living in other ways. So no, not at less cost. Furthermore, it's fundamentally limited: once we decrease immigration to zero, there's nothing left we could do.

redditKeyy,t2_4cycidz,FALSE,TRUE," 

What you truly are, is life itself, and the witness of life. You are not the thought and the story made by the mind, you are not the self-image created by the mind. You are pure presence, you are very light, very pure, very joyful, very loving, very compassionate, very true and authentic, the holy presence of the universe appears before you in this moment. You are the ever-present consciousness, that one element of life that never came and wont go, your truest self.

You are not coming and going thoughts and beliefs, they are like clouds, you are the sky in which they appear.

Consciousness can be conditioned to believe it is the mind, to believe it is doubtful, to believe it is anxious, to believe it is depressed. Consciousness naturally is none of these things, it is only when the consciousness believes in the thoughts that appear, and identifies itself as these thoughts, that reality appears from the perspective of the thought, and that changes how you perceive life. What you must do is understand that is simply thought, thought is perceived, and you are able to perceive the perceiver of thought. What you are has nothing to do with thought, you are way beyond thought, thought is just limitation to what you are.

The mind won't be able to comprehend this but there is one thing that is still listening and reading and completely understanding what I am saying intuitively for it is the holy presence that you are, the pure awareness completely recognizes what I am conveying for it is true within yourself, your heart is truly overflowing with love with any moment, you simply do not look at it, and you look at the distractions the mind is presenting ( all kinds of thoughts that have personal interest in them), these thoughts only continue and make the illusion of being a separate entity from life, feeling alone and abandoned, feeling fearful etc.

The moment you realize that all this appears within you and can be perceived, you will come to a place of seeing very pure, very quiet, very silent, very beautiful, you will be naturally yourself and have a clarity of life.

You won't change, nothing will happen, you'll just shift the perception from thought-based perception to consciousness-based perception. Instead of perceiving thought you will be perceiving the perceiver himself, and just doing that will bring infinite joy, love, peace, compassion and serenity to experience. You mustn't suffer your experiencing, it is only when you rest your attention on the suffering that you suffer. When you rest your attention on your own being, you feel serene, tranquil and beautiful within. Natural well-being.

Thoughts, emotions and sensations are not something that can help or be useful to the highest intelligence, awareness itself. Thoughts, emotions and sensations all appear to that which you are, because you are that which is able to perceive them. They wouldn't exist without you. You are not dependant on them, they simply appear because you are. You are such a vast intelligence that simply everything appears within you, the whole universe itself, including thoughts, emotions and sensations.

You do not need to be attached to any thoughts, emotions and sensations, nor to be attached to anything that appears within that which you are, for they have nothing to do with what you truly are, you are not affected by anything that is, because you are that which is. You just stay that which you are, stay in the silence of your own being. The highest intelligence does not give any importance to any thoughts, emotions and sensations because it is aware of its own silence.

The highest intelligence does not use thoughts, emotions and sensations in order to be. It is completely free from all of these appearing phenomena, it is not the phenomena and not the creator of the phenomena, it is all imagined within that highest intelligence which you are. You are not bound to something that appears within you, you are that greater in which it appears. You must stay in awareness of what you truly are, you must trust in that which you are.

The highest intelligence won't be heard, because it doesn't like to talk. It would rather simply be, be in its own divine being and simply be aware of the vastness. The highest intelligence is easily perceived when one simply turns its attention on one's self. It is easily perceived because it is all that is. Every single thing in existence is that highest intelligence and an expression of the highest intelligence. There is nothing but the highest intelligence alone, pretending to be certain forms, pretending to be thought, pretending to be emotions, sensations, humans, life, death, these are all things it pretends to be, but in truth there is only itself alone. All these are not true, but appearances, when you believe these appearances you lose sight of what is true, the highest intelligence that is ever-present. The highest intelligence is the most obvious thing that is, but it is so subtle that everything misses it. It doesn't take much to realize that presence that you are. Truly you are that.

The highest intelligence does not give in to any doubt, that which gives in to doubt is not the highest intelligence, it is merely thought, and that highest intelligence is aware of that thought. The highest intelligence has no fear of the unknown, since it is itself the unknown, and it is able to know itself through that which is perceived. By realizing all that appears, appears within the highest intelligence, including your own sense of self, even that dissolves into the silence of the highest intelligence that you are.

Every single thought you entertain, every single emotion you entertain, every single sensation you entertain, simply takes you away from the recognition of what you truly are. Do realize that you are simply beyond them, there is nothing to do with them. Both what appears to be ""good"" and ""bad"" is the highest intelligence itself. There is no good and no bad, these are just thoughts, the highest intelligence doesn't see good or bad, it only sees itself and is what it is.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874434,2020-05-18T23:47:14Z,NA,0,t1_fr2x6nl,fr2x6nl,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gmd5ua,t1_fr2x6nl,TRUE,t1_fr2x697,/r/spirituality/comments/gmd5ua/alcohol_and_spirituality/fr2x6nl/,1,gmd5ua,spirituality,t5_2qhc5,0,1,2020-05-18T23:47:16Z

NimusNix,t2_nht4b,FALSE,FALSE,">The lemming-like frenzy to defeat trump combined with the assumption that the most right-wing primary candidate must be the most likely to pick off never-trumpers?

Sanders and his supporters spent the last three years trying to convince Democratic voters that he had the crossover appeal to pick off those never Trumpers.  


And yet he failed.  He also had a message that he would help raise up the little guy, break down the institutions maintaining the status quo and bring about economic justice.  He has had the spotlight since late 2015.  


And yet he was rejected.  By a majority of Democratic voters.  


Sanders sin is the same mistake Obama and Democrats made in 2009.



He pushed for too much change.  The voting public likes stability.  You can be pissed about that.  I don't like it either.  But I understand it.  You, the people on this sub, Sanders and his team don't get that.  



'Status quo Joe' is an insult, but it is exactly what the voters want.  It isn't lemming like.  People have homes, jobs, families and businesses  they want to take care off.  Trump has disrupted that in ways many voters feared and many others did not anticipate. 


So, fundamentally what you and the Sanders team missed wasn't that voters are lemmings, it is that they are normal everyday people with normal everyday concerns.  


Sanders failed to talk to those people in a way that they could understand how his policies would help everyone in the long run.


Status Quo Joe did.

TheKelpKid,t2_16bac8,FALSE,FALSE,"Hi there! I’m so sorry to hear about your loss and your current circumstances. I’m going through this situation currently, so I thought I’d chime in too.

My 14 year old shih tzu was recently hospitalized because he woke up one morning and couldn’t walk. Thankfully he came back okay, but his quality of life is starting to diminish (he was diagnosed with a heart murmur, hypertension, low blood sugar, & osteoporosis). Pretty soon after he got home, I sat my family down and had that tough conversation with them. Not everyone was on board immediately, but it was worthwhile to at least have them thinking about it. It took a little bit, but they’ve slowly started to come to terms with the idea.

Keep in mind, your family may not come around right away. Just give them a little time to sit and process everything. You can start the conversation off by stating your concerns/observations, “Hey so I’ve been noticing lately that Cherie isn’t doing too great. I think it’s getting to a point where we should discuss the possibility of putting her down”. Emphasize that you love her, and that you don’t want to prolong her suffering. Again, your parents might shut you down, but just give them time and do your best to not take any negative reactions personally. You may also have to be the one in your family to start researching details on the process/ have a plan in place for when the time comes. 

Something my therapist said to me was that I’d probably feel more guilt if I were to prolong my dog’s suffering, than if I put him down. For humans, fighting through pain and rigorous treatment is worth it to spend more cognizant time with loved ones. Dogs arguably don’t understand the trade-off of staying alive longer if they are in pain, especially if their mental state has deteriorated. Wishing you the best of luck with the situation! I hope it works out for you.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874443,2020-05-18T23:47:23Z,NA,0,t1_fr2x798,fr2x798,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gm4zgc,t1_fr2x798,TRUE,t3_gm4zgc,/r/Advice/comments/gm4zgc/im_not_sure_if_its_time_to_convince_my_parents_to/fr2x798/,1,gm4zgc,Advice,t5_2qjdm,0,1,2020-05-18T23:47:25Z

ShadetreeSawbone,t2_m4r8dkb,FALSE,FALSE,"I use and Asgard 3 pre out to my Adcom GFA 535 power amp I got for $120 on Craigslist and I love the setup. Absolutely zero complaints. You mentioned somewhere wanting value and not mentioning a price range. Power amp technology is going to be pretty similar for old and new stuff within the same class and above some threshold of not being shitty. Well at least for A/B stuff- probably digital has gotten better over the last 10yrs more so than A/B has gotten better over the last 10yrs. Buying used from eBay or CL or buying refurb from somewhere like SafeandSoundHQ will definitely increase your value per cost no matter what price range you’re looking to spend in. Using Modi pre out to something like my Adcom or the higher power 545 from them. Or from a parasound or NAD or whosever amp you want to consider will probably be fine. If you’re buying new, buy from somewhere like crutchfield with a good return policy. Buy a couple units and listen to both. Keep the one you like more and send back the other. I recently did this for a budget and a more expensive option with the Saga + and Asgard 3 as preamps in my setup and didn’t hear a $200 difference in the Saga + so will be sending it back shortly.

ClassicalSnake,t2_32x2qdni,FALSE,FALSE,"What is meant by credentialism is essentially knowledge from authority. Isn't it? For example, Dave might take his car to a certified mechanic to fix it. This is because he doesn't know the ins and outs of how the car works. The mechanic gives a recommendation of what needs to be fixed, and because of Dave's lack of expertise in the area, he has to place his faith in the mechanic, and trust their judgment. 

I actually think this type of scenario, although inevitable in our society, ought to be minimised as much as possible. Dave with no means to engage with the mechanic's knowledge, is actually in a very vulnerable position. This type of blind faith scenario does not fair well for him. Intellectually and morally.

I think on a broader level, this is a problem liberal democracies are having. We might very well place our faith in the expert, intellectual, or academic, to get them to fix the world's problems for us. But what if they were to lie?

This is a good community to hang out in. A lot of women here have yo-yo'd and then have achieved weight loss success. It is very motivating to read their stories and how they have coped with plateaus, family pressure, depression and regaining. 

For me it helped to look at regaining as lessons learned. I will have to count calories probably for the rest of my life, and measure portions with a food scale and weigh myself daily.

After man years of yo'yo'ing, I am now learning some permanent good lifetime habits like: drinking more water, less booze, walking, figuring out the right macros, counting calories, weighing food etc etc. 

And realizing now that maintenance will means consistently practicing the good habits learned while losing weight. And nipping weight gain when five pounds (or ten or whatever) above the healthy range.

Casterly,t2_6g2lv,FALSE,FALSE,"> but you can't dismiss that if Bernie had not been demonized by popular media he might have had a shot. But low and behold the media is owned by the type of billionaires Bernie wanted to take on.

See I cannot buy this argument.  If that was the case, then why run at all?  The campaign knew from the start they had no media pull, or at least not as much as other candidates, but they were convinced they still had the numbers to sweep aside any disadvantages like that.

What happened was the young voters they gambled everything on didn’t show up.  I met plenty myself in Austin, a college town where Sanders is incredibly popular.  There were so many who just didn’t feel like putting in the time, or just left when they saw the lines.  I was asked multiple times the night of Super Tuesday who I had voted for when people saw my voted sticker.  I told them Sanders, and every one of them said a variation of “I voted Sanders too...or I would have.  I didn’t have time.” That didn’t bode well, and it was confirmed the next morning that the key demographic just didn’t show. 

I don’t know if it’s large-scale apathy, people more concerned with posting about Sanders on social media for popularity rather than actually voting for him, or just plain ignorance (I know plenty of people who weren’t even aware it was election day).  But the youth were not moved even remotely close to expectations, and Sanders tried to pivot to moderates too late (he began running ads featuring Obama saying nice things about him the days following Super Tuesday to appeal to moderates).  

And worst of all, he never tried to build a coalition of voters.  Had no minority outreach, specifically to black voters.  He never attempted to meet with the black caucus leaders.  He had to be presses by his staff to call Cortez for an endorsement that he took for granted, but was in danger of going to Warren, who was calling her everyday.  Sanders himself admits he “doesn’t do bullshit” like birthday cards, but that kind of personal touch doesn’t cost you anything and it is crucial in politics.  You can’t have a revolution without friends and allies, and without the expected youth vote, that’s what he desperately needed.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874470,2020-05-18T23:47:50Z,NA,0,t1_fr2x8zi,fr2x8zi,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gm3jx5,t1_fr2x8zi,TRUE,t1_fr2v92g,/r/politics/comments/gm3jx5/hypocrisy_watch_republicans_who_championed/fr2x8zi/,1,gm3jx5,politics,t5_2cneq,0,1,2020-05-18T23:47:52Z

rm28289,t2_63f59pk7,FALSE,FALSE,"Hi non-profiters,

We are a student run nonprofit that just launched in Connecticut. We were working on several pamphlets to promote education reform in the country but had not published any yet.

However, we just got a break on an issue that we have used to gather a good amount of student interest and excitement relating to the College Board's AP Exams and their activities. Many students were passionate about this due to their dislike of the organization and we found that instead of letting them waste their energy spamming the comments on the twitter and instagram accounts of the organization, we could use their efforts to help make real changes by speaking to local legislators and school officials. 

We are also working to collect funding to provide technology to students in need. This project may be expensive but we feel that it will be high impact and grow our support base and hopefully garner future donations.

Our website is below. It is still barebones at the moment but we are working to secure a real domain and make it official. Please look at our pages and reach out to me with questions and suggestions on how to grow and expand into other states across the United States.

SentinelDuality,t2_2vsdslrc,FALSE,FALSE,"while other folks have probably already explained it:

vsync is a setting you can turn on that forces the game to render each of its frames at a fixed rate.

the framerate depends on the speed at which your monitor can show those frames; for example, the average monitor can show 60 frames a second, so with vsync enabled, the game will only render 60 frames each second.

this helps reduce screen tearing, a visual artifact where multiple frames try to display on your monitor at the same time, causing a noticeable splitting or banding effect.

it does, however, chew up a lot of your GPU's resources, so it's best turned off if you have weak hardware or don't mind the tearing",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874491,2020-05-18T23:48:11Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xadd,fr2xadd,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gmbv5r,t1_fr2xadd,TRUE,t3_gmbv5r,/r/Astroneer/comments/gmbv5r/what_does_the_vsync_setting_under_display_do/fr2xadd/,1,gmbv5r,Astroneer,t5_3a7t1,0,1,2020-05-18T23:48:13Z

Longevity is what counts, being at a certain level sustainably is what ensures future success through financial superiority. 

If Leverkusen is what Dortmund is to Bayern, it doesn’t matter if they are better than Dortmund for an odd season, at the end of the day it’s still a different class of club, the reason Brandt forced a move for almost half his value, the same reason Dortmund is the only team that can challenge Bayern for a title because the law of deminishing returns on player value.

If you have a pretty regular sleep pattern your temp is beginning to rise before your normal wake up time regardless.

The closer you temp to the early hours of the morning, the closer to true BBT your temp will be. So essentially the earlier the better.

In saying that, if you are only looking to see a temp shift then just temping at the same time every day after rest is all that is needed. You can even temp in the evening after laying down for around an hour and resting. The temps will be overall higher but many women are still able to see a temp shift.

The problem is that the concept of liberty has expanded to include positive liberty as well. You're not truly free if your choice is to work for a pittance wage or die. You're not truly free if the circumstances of your birth lock you into the same situation you find yourself born in.

Citation needed

IPCC studies these issues every year and has not needed to update their stats(because they are still accurate).  They are the ref.  You might not like their numbers, but they are the best we have.  

>Biomass, being net zero, does not increase air pollution in a life cycle.

Yes smoke is not air pollution.  \s  

>Enter.. interconnectors

How much is that going to cost?  Did you include that in your calculations?  Of course you didn't.  A fully connected HVDC transmission grid is going to be hard to build.  How long would it take to build one?  Now we should have built one decades ago because it will take that long to build 

Do you have to pay people to take your excess electricity?  Germany and California both have to do that which drives up costs.  

>Build it out in the middle of nowhere, it really doesn't have that much impact

Flooding areas always has an impact.  Do not diminish that fact.  They also face local opposition.  My state, California, is having trouble building one new pumped hydro station right now.  

> More than viable

Yet the national academy of science has discredited the leading plan using pumped hydro.  Hint it is not viable.  [Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722)

>Do math

Google Capacity factor.  Google intermittency.  Those things will not go away magically.

JUSTpleaseSTOP,t2_jyrli,FALSE,FALSE,"Depends. In general, do your roulettes every day, or at least leveling and alliance raid roulettes. MSQ roulette gives a ton of so but it's time consuming. Tanks and healers can pretty much just spam their highest level dungeon and be fine. DPS should do PotD to 60 and then HoH to 70. After that, they should spam trusts.

That being said, some of those things will get tedious after a while. Male sure to break up your grind a little bit here and there.

Some more general tips:

-Do beast tribe dailies while you wait for a queue to pop. 

-If you don't want to do a deep dungeon or trusts, put your highest few dungeons on queue and do your beast tribes.

-If you're still waiting, Fates and side quests can also boost you a bit.

-Shadowbringers sidequests scale to your level so they're always pretty decent bumps if you're waiting. Just pick up a bunch at once in an area and start clearing them out.

-Make sure to have a food buff up as much as possible.

KickedInThePaduach,t2_na7fd,FALSE,FALSE,"Latest science, is not all women have them (g-spot). There was a scientific study in Italy, ten or maybe more years ago, that used some kind of imaging technique. 

I'd venture, it is a small percentage overall, maybe as low as 1 in 5 with half of those unresponsive, so \~10% is my guess.  And even if the feature is there many women don't respond. Many more just don't even have the feature.  I've seen estimates that half or even only 30% of women can climax from intercourse alone. 

The confusing part is some percentage of porno squirting is just actual peeing. That makes is seem more common.  One of the old sex tomes, kinsey or masters and johnson book maybe, described 4 separate female orgasm types, Clitoral (most common, Cervix (where it pushes down to grab seamen) can lead to a gush like experience where fluid is pushed out vag, Uterine(internal of the uterus), and Urological (squirting). Also some few women can climax from nipple stimulation, again needle in haystack fairly rare.  I'd say most of this is all still under researched. Just a bunch of random memories from personal experience and reading. 

Another theory is it is merely part of the clitoris, and not all of them go that farback to line up with the upper lining of the vagina.  Here is a book link set to a page with reference to study, one couple scanned with ultrasound during intercourse. \[not very romantic, but definitely geeky pro science\].  [https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&pg=PA145#v=onepage&q&f=false) 

I've experienced that with 2 women, and maybe a couple more had some indication of the feature, but I'm happy without that happening again, long settled down and quite happy with out that one thing. Basically you have to play the cards you're dealt.  And if your partner is able to climax, especially with you any amount of your times together, you've already done better than most pairings.

It has a  polymer receiver and stock which are one-piece so I cannot put a new stock on it.  Mine has a nice set of express sights.

MakeThePieBigger,t2_wgv0c,FALSE,FALSE,">I think we are at a point where this discussion is stalled. Club goods are examples of non-rivalrous goods. It's in the very definition. But you are disgreeing with the definition of club goods, because it does not suit your definition of property. Admittance to the concert IS the non-rivalrous good.

**YOU ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME! PLEASE LISTEN TO ME!**

I am not disputing that club goods are non-rivalrous, I am disputing that they are property. The subscription/ticket/license/token are not club goods, the music/movie/software/gameplay are. You for some reason seem to be conflating the ticket with the concert, despite the fact that they are obviously two separate things. The ticket is rivalrous property, the concert is non-rivalrous club good. You need the former to get access to the latter, hence excludability of a club good. THAT IS WHAT I AM SAYING!

A concert might not have any tickets at all and instead charge an entrance fee. Would money be a club good in this case? - OF COURSE NOT! The concert and only the concert is the club good and is non-rivalrous. 

>And no, I don't agree that property is ONLY a conflict resolution mechanism. There are plenty of examples of property violations that don't cause conflict, such as trespassing on private land when the owner is away.

By ""conflict"", I mean disagreements as to the uses of an object. If two people wish to use a single rivalrous object in different ways, they cannot both do so and one must take precedence over the other. And who gets to decide is answered by property rights.

So in your example the owner and the walker have different ideas as to how the land should be used in this instance: the owner wants it to stay empty (otherwise they would allow the walker to pass and there would be no trespass), while the walker wants to use it as a path. Property rights tell us that the owner gets precedence and the walker would be in the wrong, if they disregard that. The fact that the owner might not immediately become aware of the trespass is irrelevant.

>And yes, of course there can be conflict over non-rivalrous goods! For example, someone could demand a refund for an admission ticket and the venue could refuse the refund. Or take any IP lawsuit.

And in both of these cases the conflict is clearly over quite rivalrous money. The disagreement is not on how the music should be used (this even sounds absurd), but over who gets to keep the money that was exchanged for the ticket.

>And, finally, you cannot arrive at morality through logic. This is philosophy 101. People have realized this since David Hume.

Firstly, this is quite a bold statement: there are plenty of people who disagree with Hume (and he might not have even supported the idea himself).

Secondly, regardless of their acceptance of Hume's guillotine, there are numerous schools of moral philosophy that use logical arguments to justify their positions. All proponents of objective morality certainly do, be they utilitarians or natural-rights deontologists.

widget1321,t2_15948y,FALSE,FALSE,"Then why did you offer that previous justification?

And you seem to be misunderstanding my position. My position isn't that artillery is definitely not covered under the 2A. It's that I'm not aware of anything that makes it clear that warships filled with artillery, specifically, are covered by the second amendment and thus CAN'T be banned. Since you said it very clearly applied to entire warships filled with artillery, I wanted to know where that sentiment came from (to restate my position: whether or not artillery is covered under the 2nd amendment, I don't think there's anything that makes it clear that artillery, specifically, is covered).

Congress being allowed to offer letters of marque doesn't make that clear, all it makes clear is that Congress doesn't HAVE to ban them. 

If there's something that DOES make it clear, I want to read it. You say there are writings of the founders that make it clear that artillery/warships is covered by the 2nd amendment, can you please point me at those?  I'm sorry I don't have any writings to point to that say something like ""we are not going to discuss whether artillery is covered under this amendment"" so it's hard to prove my position, but it is easy to disprove if there is discussion by the founders saying that artillery is covered.

This replaces the lowest estimate of IFR of 0.33%, but remains below the highest estimate of 1.0% (Ref. 11).

jkraps,t2_5bivc7xw,FALSE,FALSE,"1: I said that the far right uses the term as a way to dehumanize undocumented residents, interesting that you conflate the far right with conservatives. 

2: It's interesting that you discredit any source of information that could possibly conflict with your worldview. Yes according to scholars, according to journalists, according to immigrants the term is offensive.

3: Yah heard of dog whistles? Yes the majority of conservatives aren't explicitly  racist, most likely most of you guys will treat POC with as much deference as white folk. But many of you will support policies that disproportionally effect POC negatively, and many people on the left will say you are racist as shorthand for your policies harm POC, which is a mistake IMO. That being said one can not ignore the growing threat of the far right nationalist movement, and how they've been validated by a lot of the rhetoric of Trump.

4. I think you misunderstood my argument. My argument is that legal language needs to change to reflect how the everyday person understands language. When you bring up the idea of what an alien is, I think it's reasonable to assume that most people will not think of immigrants but rather they will think of E.T.s . It is by definition dehumanizing to refer to a person as a non-human entity, as such it can be concluded that calling illegal residents of the US aliens, is a case of dehumanization.

shadowh511,t2_5virf,FALSE,FALSE,"# l'ewa

## Independent Clause Structure

Most of the time L'ewa sentences have only one clause. This can be anything from a single verb to a subject, verb and object. However, sometimes more information is needed. Consider this sentence:

    The dog which is blue is large.

This kind of a relative clause would be denoted using `hoi`, which would make the sentence roughly the following in L'ewa:

    le wufra hoi blanu xi brado.

The particle `xi` is needed here in order to make it explicit that the subject noun-phrase has ended.

Similarly, an incidental relative clause is done with with `joi`:

    le  wufra  joi              blanu    ke brado
    the dog,   which by the way is blue,    is big.

## Questions

There are a few ways to ask questions in L'ewa. They correlate to the different kinds of things that the speaker could want to know.

## ma

`ma` is the particle used to fill in a missing/unknown noun phrase. Consider these sentences:

    ma   blanu?
    what is blue?
    ro  qa madsa   ma?
    you are eating what?

## no

`no` is the particle used to fill in a missing/unknown verb. Consider these sentences:

    ro no?
    How are you doing?
    le wufra xi no?
    The dog did what?

## so

`so` is the particle used to ask questions about numbers, similar to the ""how many"" construct in English.

    ro madsa so spalo?
    You ate how many apples?
    le so zasko xi qa'te glowa
    How many plants grow quickly?

## Color Words

L'ewa uses a RGB color system like computers. The basic colors are red, green and blue, with some other basic ones for convenience:

|English|L'ewa|
|:-|:-|
|blue|blanu|
|red|delja|
|green|qalno|
|yellow|yeplo|
|teal|te'ra|
|pink|hetlo|
|black|xekri|
|white|pu'ro|
|50% gray|flego|

Colors will be mixed by creating compound words between base colors. Compound words still need to be fleshed out, but generally all CVCCV words will have wordparts made out of the first, second and fifth letter, unless the vowel pair is illegal and all CCVCV words are the first, second and fifth letter unless this otherwise violates the morphology rules. Like I said though, this really needs to be fleshed out and this is only a preview for now.

For example a light green would be `puoqa'o` (`pu'lo qalno`, white-green).",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874554,2020-05-18T23:49:14Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xemn,fr2xemn,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gmbwb5,t1_fr2xemn,TRUE,t3_gmbwb5,/r/conlangs/comments/gmbwb5/reconlangmo_5_sentence_structure/fr2xemn/,1,gmbwb5,conlangs,t5_2red7,0,1,2020-05-18T23:49:18Z

Despite being the biggest star in the world during his playing career Jordan did relatively few interviews. This is especially true once his career was done. There was a lot of mystery (and still is to a degree) with Jordan.

Jordan is a bit of an old fashioned celebrity in the sense that he isn't over exposed through constant interviews and social media posts. And because of that there is this aura of mystique built around his legacy. Jordan had almost became this folk hero where you wondered how much fact was mixing in with fiction. You'd hear these legendary stories of his competitiveness but they were all being told by other people. Some of it started to almost sound like folk-legends people would tell about old baseball players from the 20s. 

Hell just look at how people reacted to him speaking at Kobe's funeral. Everyone was just so happy to hear him talk and they were genuinely surprised when he cried, joked about himself and appeared human.

NanoCyde,t2_3wf7s1q,FALSE,FALSE,"Modularization in the PUBG code would be a huge step forward.

There is a reason why it seems like every time they introduce a feature they have to pull it back. 

Examples: 

Follow jump leader introduced then pulled as it caused performance issues.  
In Hawkinz own words: "" It was causing some issues with crashing I believe, unsure of it's current status ""  [https://twitter.com/Hawkinz/status/1262204527228272640](https://twitter.com/Hawkinz/status/1262204527228272640) 

And then the whole blood splatter improvements from patch 5.2 that was recently reverted as they were causing issues.

I really hate to think of the spaghetti code mess that is the PUBG code. Just as an external observer, I can see issues that are clearly caused from this issue.

Another one I want to throw in is the line of sight sound bugs. It blows my mind that this is still an issue. The fact that something like this, which is insanely critical in a game like PUBG, hasn't been fixed tells me the code has to be all over the place. I feel sorry for whoever is the bug hunter over at PUBG.

_waxy_,t2_5g4kcmjs,FALSE,TRUE,">Lmao, “absurd nuances” of a word that was used to dehumanize and make black people feel less than a dog

Oh fucking please, if there wasn't nuance it wouldn't be used so much in song lyrics in the first place. Hell *I've* been called that by black people and I'm white as fuck! 

As for the rest of that post, what the actual fuck does that have to do with any of this? The problem there was the hoses, the dogs, the weapons, not the word. The problem there was institutional power, not the language it uses. Power is material. At this point in my life I piss on the degenerate factions of the left who reduce all power to linguistics and then act surprised when they meaningless culture war leads nowhere but trump. 

Power is physical. Power is real. Racism only matters because of power. Not because of feelings, not because of emotions, not because of language. Because of a man with a fucking gun saying ""freeze"". Whether he says a particular word after the comma in ""freeze,"" doesn't mean jack shit unless you pour yourself into that situation. 

Oh don't get me wrong, words can hurt, words can be used to justify hurt, but the word is an expression of something greater and always was. A word is only as meaningful or meaningless as the actions surrounding it. And that's what people like you fucking miss: you think words are more important than action. I think you're full of shit. Because I live in the real world. 

Know what killed those girls in a church? A bomb. 

Know what killed Arbury? A bullet.

Know what beat up civil rights protesters? The police. 

Know what didn't? A white idiot singing song lyrics written by a black guy. 

Take your false moral righteousness and choke to death on it. I don't need or want your love.

AutoModerator,t2_6l4z3,FALSE,TRUE,"Read this comment in its entirety or get banned. Consider checking out /r/entitledredditors instead. If you contact us with a question that can be answered by this comment, you will be banned permanently and your internet will be revoked. 


Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  


This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit. 


Comment karma is *not* the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. **Go to https://old.reddit.com/user/me/ to see both kinds of karma.** Use desktop mode. If you claim to have enough comment karma because you don't understand there are 2 kinds of karma, you will be banned.


The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.  


Questions? Everything you could possibly ask us has been answered. Again: **if you ask us a question that can be answered by this message, you will be banned.**

They stopped being intimate maybe a year or so before her and I met, she pushed him away because of some stuff in their past (which actually wasn't even his fault) and then I guess through our extended arguments, she realized how stable and supportive her husband was.

As for it being a wake up call for him to shape up, maybe. I thought that initially as well but she says he actually never stopped acting that way, she just didn't appreciate it until our fallout.

Regarding everything else.. I genuinely appreciate your input. The thing is, I don't feel like I've been abused. Maybe I have and I've just allowed myself to accept it and not realize, I dunno. But she was always great to me. Except for the fact that I always got blamed for our fights because she says she's never fought with men before in relationships and her husband never argues or causes problems and he's ""exceptional"", so of course it must be me.
I feel like we would miscommunicate which led to arguments, but it always ended up being my fault.

Anyways, even knowing her husband knew.. The deleting messages thing was very fishy to me. She also did it only on one social media account when we regularly talked across 5 different accounts.

I genuinely trusted that she would never have taken advantage of me, but.. With everyone saying essentially the same thing (though of course no one has the full story), it's making me question my sanity a bit.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874575,2020-05-18T23:49:35Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xfyo,fr2xfyo,FALSE,TRUE,t3_glpwuu,t1_fr2xfyo,TRUE,t1_fr10ue4,/r/polyamory/comments/glpwuu/i_was_in_a_longdistance_open_relationship_with_a/fr2xfyo/,1,glpwuu,polyamory,t5_2qu5n,0,1,2020-05-18T23:49:37Z

deathstarr808,t2_bjfei3h,FALSE,FALSE,"You’ll probably get the full amount or something you’re ok with. The difference between a chapter 11 and say a 13 (which is reorganization but for individuals instead of businesses) is that the creditors for the most part get paid a much larger percentage of what they’re owed, if not all of it in a chapter 11. In a 13, creditors are most often paid pennies on the dollar. 

It’s just that, with the bills piling up and the overwhelming late fees and penalties that come with that, it’s difficult to get all of your creditors on board with a plan that’s actually feasible.

>Due to the **severity of SARS-CoV infection**, the potential for rapid spread of the disease, and **the absence of proven effective and safe in vivo inhibitors of the virus**, it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections.

>We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of **primate cells**. These inhibitory effects are observed when the **cells** are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, **suggesting** both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This **may** negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.

SARS-CoV had a 15% mortality rate. Medicine is all about weighing the risks against the potential benefits, though I'm not surprised this subtlety is lost on you. But let's not play coy here. If Trump hadn't run his mouth off and gotten shit for this, you wouldn't be pushing this.

Eeech,t2_vredy,FALSE,TRUE,"Thanks; that helps make a lot of sense of it. 

I really like your choice of color and texture; it really brings out the life in the picture. I am seriously disappointed in the lack of excitement over your shitty MS Paint, but I digress. 

Congratulations to John; he's officially an idiot. Absent an extant right of way, and the fact he split his own property that had road access and landlocked an undeveloped lot -- he screwed himself. There is an extraordinarily low chance that he would prevail in court fighting to obtain use of your father's lot. I use ""extraordinarily low"" here because ""hahahaha lol nope"" isn't a very professional way to phrase it, and technically there is always some chance of factors we don't know here to surface. On top of the fact that it's generally not possible to decide to develop a landlocked property and decide that a adjacent lot has to give up land for access in a situation like this, the expense of litigation that one would almost assuredly lose just for spite is one of those ""don't cut off your nose when you're mad at your face"" type things. 

In your father's position, I'd probably just ignore him until he actually serves your father with a lawsuit trying to force the matter. Since it will cost him $10k at least to retain an attorney willing to do it, I'd put the chance of that happening in the ""hahahaha lol nope"" range of probability as well.

-AzureCrux-,t2_210xhebr,FALSE,FALSE,"I ended up going back to a 2650x1440 because of the lack of support in FPS games, but I am able to run the game with everything maximum at 100-110 fps with the following hardware:

Ryzen 7 2700x (Processor doesn't matter too much, I barely see 20% playing

Asus STRIX 1080Ti (100% utilization all the time, prepare for some heat) - this is about on par with a 2070

I also run with 16 gigs of RAM, so no need to go crazy. 

&#x200B;

Note I play with some basic Reshade enabled and have some enhanced texture mods (Hair, eyes, etc), so those might be weighing my performance down some also.

&#x200B;

If you're running 3440x1440p, a 2070 should net you over 60 FPS, but you might have to make a small number of concessions. You can turn shadows from 2048 to 1024 and it still looks great, and not all of the post processing is necessary.

&#x200B;

If you can afford to ball out, I would get a 2080 so you don't have to upgrade for quite a while (I might even skip the 3000 series cards, my 1080Ti is so solid still). Otherwise a 2070 should do you great.

But he persisted in seeing her for a few hours a week because he wanted her to have a dad. And he always tried to treat her with as much love as possible, no matter what he was feeling.

Well, now she’s three and he loves her. He can’t see her now because of the pandemic. (Her grandmother, who lives with her, is in critically poor health and we live an hour and a half away in NYC.) He tells me he misses her. Of course he does. When she hears us at the door you can hear her screaming, “Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!” She loves him so much. He still doesn’t want to have more kids, but it’s honestly kind of nice to go see her on the weekends. I think with visitation arranged through the court you’d have the kid every other weekend.

I guess the question stands.. what interests you about the lore? Everything? Races such as elder? Chaos? Tyranids? Orks? There is so many novels dedicated to each race explaining so much. 

I really enjoyed the night lords series which consists of the books in order - soul hunter, blood reaver, and void stalker. 

Both series above are related to chaos, as I personally enjoy them most. But the main thing is to find what interests you and go from there. If you so happen to like Black templars then check out helsreach :) theres even a 90 minute movie about it on YouTube which is really good.

But nowadays there's this expectation that every lane is winnable.

Same deal with solo lanes, particularly top. You don't have to smash their carry into the ground. All you have to do is absorb pressure and keep them from joining teamfights and using their champion.

It’s not Duolingo who’s asking for contributors— the current team of volunteers is asking for more people. Honestly, I don’t think Duolingo cares about any of the courses. There are quite a few courses “hatching” that have 0 contributors, and Duolingo isn’t trying to find people to finish them. Some of the “completed” courses’ qualities are pretty bad too. And Duolingo just doesn’t care. So in this way I guess I just don’t see them as *exploiting* volunteers, because if there weren’t volunteers, the courses just wouldn’t exist at all. Duolingo isn’t saying “why pay people to make these courses when we can get people to make them for free!” They’re just saying, “if people want to make a course, why not let them.”

Obviously I disagree with this mentality of Duolingo not caring about the courses. They 100% should, and I agree that it would be better if they actually hired people to design all of the courses instead of only the top few that they actually care about, like French and Spanish.

KFC-LOVER-9000,t2_69vzkvgf,FALSE,FALSE,"So the current mechanics of a singles-area without a pj timer creates a meta that consists of 20-man teams of people in ancestral max mage gear and crystal shield bolt raggers to protect the mages. These teams sit logged out of the game while they scout for potential pks using scout bots or they will pretend to pk on a nooby looking account that attempts to reduce someones supplies because they focus that person. These teams are able to teleblock you infinitely due to having the tber tb you then die to an NPC then return. Because Jagex keeps pushing out Best in Slot gear over the years, these teams get more and more powerful. It is also impossible for a pker to fight back against these teams due to the follow mechanics making the person attacking you invisible. If you turned on auto retaliate to see who is attacking you, you would be special attacked by a different person the moment you would start to deal damage.

Apart from these overpowered teams..any solo pker will find themselves extremely disadvantaged. The names of the wilderness zones ""multi-combat"" should be reserved for teams and teams should not be in ""single-combat"" areas. A solo pker will either run into these teams, or be pjed the moment he starts seriously damaging the person he is fighting. This makes the wilderness extremely safe for people in teams and solo pkers can barely compete. 

A 30-second pj timer would allow a solo pker to loot kills and logout before they would be piled by a larger team. A 30-second pj timer would allow a solo pker to actually get kill chances on the people he/she attacks because 3rd parties would not be able to interfere.  This in turn would entice people to bring more risk into the wilderness because they would not have to tank test these 20-man singles teams I spoke about.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874627,2020-05-18T23:50:27Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xjfn,fr2xjfn,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gm2prm,t1_fr2xjfn,TRUE,t1_fr2wmk5,/r/2007scape/comments/gm2prm/suggestion_tob_pet_morphs/fr2xjfn/,1,gm2prm,2007scape,t5_2wbww,0,1,2020-05-18T23:50:29Z

zeldafreakx86,t2_38zavyqh,FALSE,FALSE,"What sucks the most is that 100% of the time, you load in just in time for the whole enemy team to get their supers. They also frequently have heavy as well. I had one match in progress where I loaded in and was rocket launchered immediately. I respawned on the other side of the map and got Fist of Havoc'd almost instantly. Respawned again as Dawnblade rained down from the sky killing me and the people who obviously spawned there moments before I did. That was a bit unusual, typically you spawn, run to your teammates, turn the corner, and *then* get supered, but dying to supers as soon as you join the match in progress has to be one of the most demoralizing things in the Crucible.

Even worse is when you manage to prevent a mercy, only to die to the same players' supers *again* just when it was looking like you might be able to pull off the upset.

I don't mind losing the matches. In fact, it's pretty awesome when you join the match in progress down by a substantial margin and then you manage to turn it around and win. But I wish when Bungie decides to put me in a match in progress that I'm almost certainly going to lose, they'd compensate me with a bit of bonus super energy so there's a chance I get can get a couple super kills of my own before I'm mercied.

- who’s your support partner? You either need to be really good at Ana to make her viable as a main healer. Or you have to have another main healer and use her as an off healer.
- She’s already one of the hardest to heal with since you have to hit your shots
- She has no movement abilities to escape and bronzes aren’t gonna peel to help you.

Primary Fire Heal Rates
- Ana shoots one shot per 0.8 seconds for 75hp
- Bap has the same rate of fire but his projectiles heal 50hp and are easier to hit people and do splash healing in a 3 meter radius
- Moira heals 65 for the first second (when you press the button) and then 16.25/s for the next 4 seconds (after you stop spraying). This can hit multiple people at once
- Mercy heals for 50hp/s

Confront your demons. Strips our filters, allows us to see the world for what it really is. Makes it blatantly obvious which negative patterns you must fix to grow.

I wish I was better at expressing stuff, I could keep going, but thats pretty much the gist. I'm not contributing all of these benefits to ""entities"", as I'm mainly referring to the mental effects and visual hallucinations (walls morphing/exploding with color, apps on my phone screen moving around, etc..) 

Encounters with beings is really only achieved at a large dose of lsd (which I'm pretty much focusing on here), they are much much more common with a dose of dmt smoked through a bong/pipe, or even a decentish size dose of mushrooms. DMT's main effects only last about 15, 30 mins at most. 

These are not harmless substances, though, please dont think that's what im trying to convey. There is potential for tremendous temporary (in rare cases, permanent) psychological damage, mainly if you suffer from a mental illness such as schizophrenia.

Dear /u/ProfessorJV!

Thank you for posting on /r/resumes. Please, let we mention some important information (probably you know it).

[Wiki Guidelines about Posting a Resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index#wiki_posting_a_resume)

Please, remember to add a **flair** to your post.

Due to the extremely increasing amount of spam/scam on the sub as posts, comments, in PM, and via GoogleAds on Reddit, we have to warn everyone about it. Unfortunately, such offers imply low-quality service - and actually, they are. Such scammers were banned, and there was some feedback on their work. So please, do not trust shady offers.  
One can find trusted professionals on the wiki - there is such a list.

We wish you get support from the sub in many ways, including reading it, top posts, wiki, and searching. There were many answered questions here, please, feel free to check that.

Besides, this subreddit is better looking in the old Reddit design on the desktop in the browser with adBlockers (FireFox/PaleMoon with uBlock Origin + uMatrix): https://old.reddit.com/r/resumes/

T6 is only barely beat by Bee quiv in terms of DPS, so T7 will likely surpass it. If you really want to slow, you can simply use the T0 quiver, which is actually more MP efficient for slowing when shooting in a single direction.

I agree, it would be folly to use most event whites before getting very good gear. The tablet, for example, has the highest Damage/MP ratio for any spell and has an easy perfect spellbomb. But a beehemoth quiver just isn't all that good.

I know this is a 3D printing thread and I was wondering if anyone has or would be willing to print a prosthetic leg for a chicken. I know it sounds crazy. 
Some background: I went with a friend to castrate bulls yesterday and the owners sell guinea fowl. They keep Silkie chickens to hatch out the guinea fowl eggs and I noticed one of the Silkies was hopping. I asked the owners if I could examine her and they said yes. While I was examine the hen they asked if I wanted her, I said yes. They said she is 2 years old and was born with a bent leg. The hen can get around okay by hopping. Her leg was swollen and squishy so I made an incision to drain the fluid (after I bathed her at my house). I posted on a chicken forum and got some advice to help me help my new hen. Out of curiosity I searched for “chicken prosthetic” and someone on the chicken forum mentioned this thread. So here I am asking you kind people to help me and my sweet hen Eloise.

zzzzYUPYUPphlumph,t2_uuepf71,FALSE,TRUE,"Well, yes, extensive ""experiments"" exist showing that jumping off a 100 ft bridge to asphalt is dangerous; however, if the average age of death due to natural causes is 77 and I jump off a bridge when I am 77, I haven't changed my life-span much from the average. I may have dropped dead the next day, a year from then, or 10 years from then. No solid way to know for sure.

But, I'm not trying to understand whether a roof that never had a moss problem will outlive a roof with moss problems. I'm trying to understand whether or not a roof with moss that has the moss removed significantly outlives a roof with moss problems that is left alone or whether it is the other way around or whether, statistically, it's a wash.  I'm trying to understand what is the best advice for a moss covered roof: remove or leave alone? Is one significantly better than the other? How do we know? There should be something more than just anecdotes about roofs with moss needing replaced because, as I said above, a roof without moss can be a disaster anyway.

That leads down an interesting cross-thought with a different active thread. What if one of the many reasons for adopting LCARS is not just usability, but visual security? The regular, plain, geometric, un-themed shapes aren't just clear, they potentially have other advantages like preventing the accidental embedding of neural-hack images because the very simple design language means, the only things you ever see on screen are the things you explicitly gave permission to be on screen, right down to the UI-widget level. While we do see the occasional bit of embedded content (and of course people are video chatting all the time), those usually seem to be in dedicated frames subject to a call-up by the user.

You understood what I said but missed the point; he was an asshole *on stage.* Hyperbolic internet diatribes are one way I channel my frustration with the world in a non-destructive way. I suspect the comedy you enjoyed served a similar purpose. When I'm not channeling a persona for an audience, I am impeccably polite to anyone I don't know well; I go out of my way to make sure of it. This includes strangers in an internet game. As far as any ""superiority complex,"" I've grappled with extreme depression since I was a child; you'd have a much easier time convincing me I deserve to be euthanized than that I'm ""superior"" to anyone. Please don't make assumptions about my attitude, personality, or behavior based on a brief post on reddit. If you're really all about showing people respect for their humanity, you should know better.

On a separate note, your calling me an asshole in the same breath somewhat undercuts your point about not attacking me.

I suspect my frustration with pings stems from my tendency to play with people across the entire spectrum of player skill. My masters friends understand my pings just fine; my bronze friends tend not to. Regardless, I've lost any interest in the issue.

TaiDollWave,t2_77y0f,FALSE,FALSE,"No, she doesn't have to talk to Penny. She doesn't need to say ""Shut up, Penny!!!"" or anything. But she can tell Penny 'I don't want to have a conversation right now. I'm doing (x y or z).' Why is that wrong? She doesn't need to be held hostage to talking to Penny. And when she DOES hang out with Penny, that's not enough for you.

""It's only to get out of chores."" Okay? And? It's still getting done. ""It's only once every few weeks."" Okay? And?

She can be cordial, but she doesn't have to sit and have a conversation with Penny. If Penny is close enough to get kicked off, how close is she sitting next to Emily on the couch? It's not right at all, and I would tell Emily she can sit on the floor if she can't be polite. Penny also doesn't need to be right up in her grill if that's happening.  


Penny annoys Emily. They might never be friends or have a super close sister relationship. You keep saying you're not forcing that, I think that's your dream goal. I think you think if Emily would just hang out with Penny a little, she'd grow to love her.

If you don't want Emily to hang out in her room, take the XBox out of there. In your post, you talked about the door incident and how to punish Emily.  A few of us responded that it wasn't entirely Emily's fault in that regard, it was both of theirs. She apologized to Penny. Penny had been told multiple times to leave the door alone. She didn't. Maybe now she'll learn why she should do what you tell her. 

I agree, she should not push or hit Penny. And you can punish for that.

AutoModerator,t2_6l4z3,FALSE,TRUE,"I used to play Fortnite all night. No sleep! But ever since Obama told me to try Raid Shadow Legends for free, I am addicted. This game is a game. It has graphics. It has characters. Best of all it has a loot box mechanic to enhance my experience even more by adding another exciting chance based layer to the game! Two week ago I spend all my money becoming a Raid Shadow Legend. Now I live in a dumpster outside a McDonald’s with free WiFi. At night I sneak into the McDonald’s like my new raccoon dad, Stripey, taught me to do so I can charge my phone. Through the cracked screen I am still perpetually amazed by the graphics of this game... they look so real! Thank you Obama, you truly changed my life!

>  ""_Un hombre o una mujer inteligente nacido o nacida en la pobreza no tiene las mismas posibilidades que un mediocre nacido en la riqueza_"", postuló el presidente Alberto Fernández derribando el discurso de la meritocracia que enarbolaron los seguidores de su antecesor, Mauricio Macri, a quien derrotó en primera vuelta en octubre de 2019. El axioma del jefe de Estado bien puede aplicarse a Alejandro que canta el tango con un caño en la voz que nada tiene que envidiarle a Julio Sosa, sin embargo se encuentra en situación de calle por falta de trabajo ante la [cuarentena](http://www.minutouno.com/cuarentena-a5128306) por el [coronavirus](http://www.minutouno.com/coronavirus-a5127703).

>  El caño que Alejandro Reyna tiene en la voz recuerda a ""El barón del tango"". Así lo comentaron los que vieron el video que se hizo [viral](http://www.minutouno.com/viral-a5596) en las redes sociales. Se lo ve acodado en la barra de la pizzería ""La Paz"", un clásico reducto del barrio porteño de Mataderos, comienza a cantar una versión personal de ""De puro curda"", un tangazo de Abel Aznar.

> ""Ayudá compartiendo el video. Demos una mano. **Una voz como la de él no puede caer en desgracia"", clama el subtitulado del viral que rotó por decenas de cuentas de Twitter y grupos de WhatsApp**. El cantante vive de prestado en ese salón gastronómico a la espera de la reapertura cuando se levante el aislamiento social, preventivo y obligatorio por el coronavirus.

> ### ""LO LLAMARON DE ESPAÑA Y JAPÓN""

> Ramón es el dueño de la pizzería ""La Paz"" y de otros comercios gastronómicos de la zona que frecuentan los matarifes y manda Nueva Chicago. Le contó a _**minutouno.com**_ la génesis y los efectos del viral.

> ""**Yo estaba pintando el local y lo filmamos a Alejandro cantando. Se lo pasé a un amigo y llegó a las redes. Lo llamaron de España y Japón para cantar. Cuando esto termine le va a cambiar la vida**"", describió quien le brinda alojamiento a Alejandro Reyna.
> 
> Alejandro Reyna tiene 59 años y hasta que comenzó la cuarentena cantaba en los locales de Ramón. Tras el show con sun incomparable voz, cuidaba los coches de los comensales a cambio de una propina con la que pagaba una pieza en un hotel. Con los restaurantes cerrados por la pandemia, fue desalojado. Hace unos meses sufrió un infarto por lo que no puede realizar trabajos que impliquen un riesgo para su salud. El aislamiento lo dejó en situación de calle.
> 
> ""Le presté un local vacío para que duerma, se bañe y esté a resguardo durante la cuarentena"", describió Ramón quien se erigió en community manager ya que le abrió una cuenta de _Instagram_.

> ### COMO EL ""GOLDEN VOICE""
> 
> En 2010, Ted Williams, un ex locutor de radio, fue grabado por un periodista del Columbus Dispatch pidiendo dinero en los semáforos. Posteó el video en YouTube y su vida dio un giro de 180 grados para siempre. Fue voz de Kraft Food, MSNBC, Pepsi y Coca Cola. El ""golden voice"" pasó de ser un homeless a ser la voz de grandes marcas y empresas.

One way we could learn about Diablo Immortal beta is if influencers get invited to Blizzard for a press event. That might indicate beta is within 1-3 weeks of that press event.

We might see some updates in the Android page, or a official Diablo Immortal website update. For example, we still don't know anything about the Necromancer and Crusader abilities.

Usually fansites, press, and influencers/livestreamers get access first, with invitation waves following.

Blizzard might have some sort of announcement at the IGN Summer of Gaming event about when Beta starts.

Or they could just post a video update in YouTube and an article at the official website about plans.

elgrn1,t2_6df603t8,FALSE,FALSE,"You're definitely not alone :) Actually I posted this about confidence in another thread the other day - being super lazy and copying it here in case it helps.

Confidence is one of best traits. It needs to come from inside you, not from other people, though their approval and compliments can certainly enhance it. 

In order to be confident you need to like - or even love - yourself and embrace who you are. No person on this planet is perfect, even if they think they are. And while some of us may feel as though we aren't good looking enough, or tall enough, or short enough, or thin enough, or smart enough, or whatever enough, there is actually no rule that says you have to look or act like anyone or everyone else. There's no rule that says you have to like the same things, or do the same job, or have the same interests, or whatever. Society, and especially some social media apps, makes it seem like there is this ideal and other people have achieved it and we haven't but its marketing bullshit. Beauty, intelligence, talent, etc are all seen differently in different parts of the world we just don't always realise because it isn't what we see every day. There isn't enough inclusivity or honesty.

I am sure you have good qualities and I'm also sure you have bad ones too, like we all do. The trick is to enhance what's good about you, accept what you can't change, and improve what you can change. Confidence isn't about other people it's all about you.  Think well of yourself and you'll start to feel different and then it will grow from there. Don't make it too much about getting girls to like you, even though this is of course something you want. You have so much of your life ahead of you and you want to be a fully rounded person in that life with self respect and respect for others, your own values and ideas on life, a good sense of humour, resilience to see you through bad times, interests, hobbies, skills, and so much more. And confidence links to so much of this and will get you so far, in work and friendships not just relationships. Always be true to yourself otherwise you run the risk of trying to be who everyone else wants you to be, which is exhausting and will only lead to failure and misery. 

When I was your age I was clinically depressed and suicidal. And 22 years later you wouldn't know - actually 2 years later you wouldn't have been able to tell. If I can make it from hating everything about myself and not wanting to live to giving you this advice then I am absolutely sure you can develop your own confidence to be the person you want to be. And maybe even already are if you didn't let your insecurities get in the way. Whenever you think about what could go wrong ask what could go right. When you think negative thoughts stop yourself and think something positive. When you compare yourself to others stop and embrace your uniqueness.

There are almost 8 billion people on the planet. You're not attracted to all of them so not all 8 billion will be attracted to you. It shouldn't be about quantity but quality. And just because others may already be in relationships remember it isn't a competition. Anyone who tells you otherwise is an arsehole ;)",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874667,2020-05-18T23:51:07Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xm24,fr2xm24,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gm9xhq,t1_fr2xm24,TRUE,t1_fr2wvk0,/r/AskGirls/comments/gm9xhq/trying_to_seem_more_appealing_to_women/fr2xm24/,1,gm9xhq,AskGirls,t5_2zhpr,0,1,2020-05-18T23:51:09Z

If the economy is done won't their be mass deaths regardless?

And I also am curious as to what your idea of the 'Economy is done' is?  My perception of an economy that is done is basically everyone has to hunt for food for themselves and just about all stores close down and we go back to some old fashioned bartering system. I think something like that happening would be probably take a decade worth of locking down or something. 

If we can't get a vaccine within a year, I think people will just bite the bullet and move on with life as best as they can while factoring the risks like we have done in the past.

KidWoody,t2_9ef51,FALSE,FALSE,"I finished around 1000 longshots this weekend.  
  
I only played Hardcore, Shoothouse/Rust. I basically equipped merc thermal on every gun, ran smoke and camped. When it rotated to shipment I would, switch my optic and work on the challenges to guns not related to longshots.
  
On shoothouse I would pop a smoke, mount the low wall at either side of the map and shoot people on the opposite side that were also doing longshots, or people running down the middle. I would also sit at the back of shanty town and shoot people coming out of junkyard, or people coming across to back alley. Both seemed to work quite well for ar/lmg/smg/marksman longshots. For snipers I would only mount the low wall.  Occasionally you'll run into people that run cold blooded, but you get used to it. It becomes a fun challenge to see if you can 'outsnipe' the other person also going for longshots. 

[Shoothouse map with callouts here](https://i.redd.it/1jukpsglxqx31.jpg)
  
I actually did far better on Rust than I did shoothouse though, because often I wouldnt find people camping for longshots in shoothouse, but sightlines are easy to camp in Rust.  The thermal is also super helpful on Rust as it eliminates the annoying dust trails that billow up.
  
For Rust, I used three spots. Either in the back of the crates looking at the pipes to people running across, behind the drop under the pipes looking at b spawn or crates. Behind the corner at b spawn looking at the drop under the pipes or I would look across the map to crates. By camping all these and paying attention to where your team is, you could effectively camp spawns and rack up ~20 - 30 longshots a game. Now I felt terrible for camping like that but, dont hate the player, hate the game..  

[Poorly edited Rust map with sightlines](https://i.imgur.com/3KneZkP.jpg)

To keep my sanity, I put game volume at low, gave up on my kd and listened to music through my headphones. On bad games I would get maybe 3 - 5 longshots, but the good games made up for it. Some guns I was able to finish in just 4 or 5 games just because things fell in place.

owoifier,t2_38evug33,FALSE,FALSE,"Japan's obscenity waws ban aww pown. Pown depicts sex owgans coming into contact undew vawious ciwcumstances and is meant to awouse and can possibwy offend ow instiww a sense of shame. If it cannot fit that cwitewia then it is not obscene and thewefowe not pown. Natuwawwy, the common denominatow is the genitaws. Wemove ow obscuwe those and you do not have pown. Thewefowe what you awe wooking at on this page is NOT pown.

You may have thought it odd that I defined pown and gave such an odd definition at that. This is what the Japanese couwt system decided pown was aftew it was banned and no definition fow pown ow obscenity was given. The wesuwt is just as vague and easiwy expwoited as you can pwainwy see: If you can't cweawwy see the genitaws then it's not pown. I shouwd awso note that butthowes awe not considewed obscene untiw something is being insewted into them. Which wooks weawwy funny in hentai whewe it's a butthowe untiw the fwame someone makes contact and it tuwns into mosaic pixews.

To give anothew exampwe, gambwing is awso banned howevew pachinko pawwows awe pwentifuw. If you awe unawawe of what Pachinko is then I'ww spawe you the expwanation and simpwy say it's mechanicawwy vewy diffewent, but in function it's exactwy wike a swot machine. Put tokens in and potentiawwy get mowe tokens out. Except you cannot exchange those tokens fow money, as that wouwd be iwwegaw, but instead fow vawious pwizes wike teddy beaws ow something. As it happens, thewe's usuawwy a pwace outside the faciwity that is a compwetewy unwewated and totawwy independent business (wink wink) that wiww buy those pwizes fwom you fow cash. Thus you can see the woophowe. Wike pown no one seems intewested in wemoving the waw ow pwugging the woophowe.

Why? Weww, I haven't spoke to many native Japanese, but I did see one wespond in wegawds to pown ""Wook at how wow ouw wape statistics awe."" Which of couwse has nothing to do with pown and evewything to do with theiw cuwtuwe and how those stats awe even awwived at. When asked about how wight the censowship can be, to the point whewe it hides nothing, his wesponse was ""Some peopwe fowwow the waw mowe stwictwy than othews."" His wesponses makes sense to me though. It's not unwike a spowts fan justifying his favowite team's decisions because to do othewwise wouwd dwaw the iwe of his fewwow fans. This is a big pwobwem if you wive in Japan.

A common idiom I see them use is ""Naiws that stick out get hammewed down"" which ties into theiw Cuwtuwe of Shame gweatwy. I mentioned that tewm to a Japanese man I used to tawk to and his immediate wesponse was ""That shit kiwws peopwe ovew hewe."" If you do not confowm to wocaw nowms and customs you wiww be shunned. If you cause twoubwe fow othews you wiww be shamed. These things sound wike a natuwaw pawt of sociawizing, and to an extent they awe, but ovew thewe it's so bad that if you want to compwain to youw boss about something it's the nowm to take him out and buy him a few dwinks fiwst. To do othewwise wouwd be a majow sociaw faux pas (this awso comes fwom my Japanese fwiend). In the end if you keep fucking up you wiww be made to feew wike you contwibute nothing to society which means you awe the uwtimate buwden on evewyone awound you. This wesuwts in Japan's notowious suicide wate.

So, imagine being a powitician in such a society whewe pwobwems can bawewy be discussed outwight and deviating fwom the nowm is pawticuwawwy hawmfuw to one's sewf. Imagine being that guy and tewwing evewyone on an iswand pawadise with wock bottom cwime wates that the status quo is wwong and you want to wegawize these howwibwe vices. No one wants to have that image. Weww, thewe was one who made the wounds a few months ago that wanted pown to be wegaw. No idea what came of him.

I have no cwosing summawy.

TW;DW Fuck you, wead my post.

Edit: I shouwd cwawify that I occasionawwy see censowship on wowk done by Westewn awtists doing an anime stywe who seem to wike the mozaic aesthetic. It dwives me insane to see it.

sarviscreek,t2_5gfoq9km,FALSE,FALSE," 

Couple key points think folks are missing. Dave was probably completely truthful in his CHD podcast but doesn't touch on some big issues which are really driving all this. Yeah he made Sofia and Alex a great deal 500k guaranteed, cut 6 months from their contract so they can get CHD IP early etc etc..... BUTTTTT notice how he says he still keeps the majority of alcohol? If he's so generous and willing to give up all the other CHD IP why hold on to this? Because that is where the real money is at (or at least both sides think it's where it's at). The Fatjew sold his white girl rose to Budweirser for over 100 million USD! Think how much more booze Alex and Sofia were going to sell than the Fatjew when every college girl in the daddygang is going to be guzzling callherdaddy Rose or gluck gluck hard seltzer when hot girl summer finally retunrs. Despite Dave suggesting he was being super generous, he knows that if he can keep this going for a year and get the alcohol sales going, that he has a shot of making more money off this than everything he's made from Barstool.

So here's what probably really went down. Sofia and Alex knew they were about to be screwed out of not just a few hundred grand but potentially tens of millions $$$$. Sofia tells Alex that her harvard troll big shot HBO exec BF knows all the right lawyers/contacts to get them out of this and go make much more bank. Alex comes along for the ride, but when shit starts getting real it turns out suitman is an empty suit and can't pull it off. Barstool's contracts are legit and ironclad. Alex realizing the ship is going down and they're going to get nothing jumps back in bed with El presidente and they know the only way to save the ship is to blame Sofia. Don't forget this post doesn't go up without Alex posting she controls the CHD IG.

So not only are the fathers not poor as shit, sofia is letting a man run her life and Alex straight threw Sofia, her BFF under the bus to save her own ass. Very un daddygang of them but yeah at least Alex will probably come out of all this doing just fine, because no matter what anyone says we love hearing them talk about getting D even if they are literally making everything up. Although maybe this is that moment when you realize that the cool kids in high school who talk so much game actually aren't that cool and don't have that much game..........",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874703,2020-05-18T23:51:43Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xog2,fr2xog2,TRUE,FALSE,t3_glqyl6,t1_fr2xog2,TRUE,t3_glqyl6,/r/CallHerDaddy/comments/glqyl6/one_call_her_daddy_episode_from_prez_everybody/fr2xog2/,1,glqyl6,CallHerDaddy,t5_s6oo7,0,1,2020-05-18T23:51:46Z

Books that have been helpful for me, but I need to revisit them, are as other people have mentioned Educated and How to Win Friends and Influence People

The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz is good, there are a few problematic ideas with the book, but it is overall, good. I found it to be inspiring and made me want to work harder towards my goals.

Hi Im_only_kevin, 

Your post has been automatically flagged for removal because it appears you are asking:

* for brainstorming ideas.

* how to ""get started"" on a project. 

* what is the best method or approach to a project.   

* whether or not you should do a project.  

* if anyone has used a product, or for a product recommendation.
                        
While we do allow questions in /r/DIY, they must relate to a specific aspect of a project, include the research you've done to find an answer yourself and explain why that research didn't answer your question. 
                        
If you have any of these questions, some places to get help are:
            
* The [Getting Started thread](/r/DIY/about/sticky) at the top of the subreddit.  

* Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/diy) in the appropriate channel.   

* You may also try other subreddits - /r/homeimprovement, /r/woodworking, /r/electronics or /r/findareddit to help you find a subreddit applicable to your question.   
            
**Please read our help request [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/diy/wiki/guidelines#wiki_help_requests) before resubmitting.**

> After having read your text, I can't help but wonder why ""perire"" even has a past participle at all, there seems to be no way to actually use the thing. Or is it just a hypothetical / unattested form of the word?

As far as I can tell, it does not exist. As you said, there is no use for it.

> Dutch is a bit peculiar here: sometimes it's not entirely clear which of the two roles is more appropriate.

You are quite right. In fact, this behaviour is not unique to Dutch. It's actually part of what makes participles participles. The name comes from the fact that these words are part verb and part adjective. They take (=***capi****unt*) parts (=***part****es*) from both word types.

In fact, Latin itself shows that the line between participles and adjectives was blurred. The ablative singular of the present participle regularly ends in *-e*: cf. *Deo volent****e***. But in some cases, the participle was interpreted more as an adjective, and you'd get something like *in patria florent****i***, using the regular ablative ending *-i* for the adjectives of the third declension.

Now, participles happen to also be used to create certain verb tenses. In some cases, the fact that participles are both adjectives and verbs works quite well with this. If you say *hij wordt geslagen*, you can explain this as someone going from a state of not being beaten, to a state of actually being beaten. So in that sense, they ""become beaten"".

In other cases, it doesn't work that well. If I say *ik heb geslapen*, it's not as if I have  something in my possession that is slept. Here, the perfect participle is used purely to provide a way to create the perfect tense. There is no logic to it being an adjective.

Now, if you dive into the history of the language, I'm sure you can find a historical reason why the perfect participle was first used in this way. Perhaps it was first used only in cases where the fact that the participle is an adjective made more sense, after which it spread to other verbs. But as it is now, there is no logic to it.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874714,2020-05-18T23:51:54Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xp6x,fr2xp6x,FALSE,FALSE,t3_gkj63b,t1_fr2xp6x,TRUE,t1_fr26iqu,/r/latin/comments/gkj63b/can_someone_explain_this_to_me/fr2xp6x/,1,gkj63b,latin,t5_2qloa,0,1,2020-05-18T23:51:58Z

If the eero is is bridge and purely acting as a Wi-Fi access point mesh then they shouldn’t care about non-Wi-Fi devices. I’d think those devices could be plugged into the network anywhere.  Either on a switch connected to the router and “peered” with the first eero or on a switch directly connected to the first eero “peered” with the other eeros.  

The recommendation may be because having everything hanging off the gateway eero is easier since all local traffic considered the same and “on the mesh”.

Legofan970,t2_8026m,FALSE,FALSE,"The central conclusion of [the paper](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455)\--that coronavirus is much deadlier than flu--is certainly correct. However, we knew that already from other methods (like the antibody study that found about 21% of New Yorkers had been infected, which would lead to an infection fatality rate of about 0.8% when including both confirmed and probable deaths).

What about the 1.3% number? The first thing to note is that most other numbers thrown around are infection fatality rate (IFR), which includes asymptomatic people. This one is IFR-S, which includes symptomatic people only. Obviously, IFR-S is bound to be a bit higher. Which number is more relevant? That depends on whether asymptomatically infected people acquire lasting immunity, which remains unclear.

1.3% IFR-S seems plausible. However, I have some issues with the assumptions used in their model. I'll break it down as best I can:

* In an ideal world, everyone with coronavirus symptoms would get tested and test positive, and everyone who died would have been tested first. Then, calculating IFR-S would be easy: divide the number of deaths by the number of positive tests (although some asymptomatic people will also be tested, due to contact tracing).
* In the real world, many cases and deaths are missed due to limited testing.  So, calculating IFR-S is a bit harder. 
* As such, the model makes some assumptions:
   * It assumes that with increased testing, the number of missed cases and deaths will eventually go to zero, through an exponential decay process. 
   * It assumes that a smaller proportion of deaths are missed than cases, but that the proportion of cases that are missed will decline faster than the proportion of deaths that are missed.
   * It assumes that over time, the *cumulative* case fatality rate will approach the true infection fatality rate, as eventually no cases and no deaths will be missed.

They then come up with a model, which they fit to data from 116 US counties (their cumulative confirmed infections and deaths over time). They look at the trend of where the model is heading to calculate the infection fatality rate. 

I'm not qualified to assess their model/statistical methods ([details here](https://hope-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/journals/content/hlthaff/0/hlthaff.ahead-of-print/hlthaff.2020.00455/20200506/suppl/2020-00455_suppl_appendix.pdf?b92b4ad1b4f274c70877518516abb28bbebb6df1d1f51c8bc9fff6d7efc5c4b1197b8f7885f6e83f8abff918b1981eb12033108edc9250efc1a06e752f6d4d8a6db24128eaf8746c9dd863e93f4995e083a3bf18d49baf999c261453acb93aa1a1b9f584acab55d8f4d1ae222de9c68623b9f73215258d5535db889dd19af9b8d2c3dfebd7ccbbe12d217b34cc26a5ffbff2eb7d2f791b8e859ae69ecdb4cf65d232)), but I have some very serious concerns with the assumptions they used to make it:

* It's clear that the fraction of new cases and deaths that are missed is decreasing. However, there's no evidence that these numbers are decaying exponentially, or even that they're trending toward zero.
* My biggest concern is that they aren't looking at *new* cases/deaths (daily/weekly infection fatality rate) but at *total* cases/deaths (cumulative infection fatality rate). If total infections and deaths happened at a steady rate indefinitely and all of the later ones were caught, then their assumption would be correct: eventually, the early deaths and cases that were missed would be negligible in comparison to the later ones that were recorded. However, coronavirus outbreaks often have a huge peak. and then a much smaller tail. So the end bit, where cases/deaths are mostly counted, is likely to be overwhelmed by the peak in which the vast majority are missed. Then the cumulative recorded CFR will trend toward a value higher than the true IFR-S for the disease.

Would be interested to hear anyone else's thoughts on this! It is an interesting new statistical approach, even if I'm not too sure about some of the assumptions used.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589874735,2020-05-18T23:52:15Z,NA,0,t1_fr2xqk8,fr2xqk8,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gma0t4,t1_fr2xqk8,TRUE,t3_gma0t4,/r/science/comments/gma0t4/study_reports_staggering_death_rate_in_us_the/fr2xqk8/,1,gma0t4,science,t5_mouw,0,1,2020-05-18T23:52:17Z

cperiod,t2_me1k8,FALSE,FALSE,"> esp8266 single analog port appears to be limited to only 3.3V

The ESP ADC is limited to 1.0V. Some dev boards (like the Wemos D1 mini) ""hide"" this with a built-in voltage divider mapping 3.3v to 1.0V.

A [voltage divider](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/voltage-divider-calculator) is basically how you do it though. 5V down to 1.0V could be done with, say, a 330k/82k voltage divider. Use 1% or better resistors to give you reasonable precision, and you really want to stick with ""standard"" resistor values which makes it unlike you'll get *exactly* 5V-to-1V. Higher value resistors will burn less power, if that's a concern. The Wemos has a 240k/100k divider, so you can bump it to a 5V range by just adding another 160k resistance to the input.

But the ADC is only 10-bits. Good enough for checking battery voltage and other trivial stuff, but it's not great. When I need better (or more of them) then I go with an I2C ADC such as the ADS1015 (12-bit) or ADS1115 (16-bit), although there's a *lot* of different options.

Prince_of_Old,t2_ed3pheq,FALSE,FALSE,"Let's say Tyrian, Clover, and Qrow are roughly evenly matched. If anything, it seems like Clover might be more skilled than Tyrian and Qrow considering how well he does in the 1v2 but let's just stick with that they are even. That gives Qrow a 1 and 3 chance of winning assuming everyone fights everyone the same amount. I think it is reasonable that Qrow and Clover are unwilling or, at the very least, quite hesitant. Only Clover has a way of apprehending people with his cuffs making him the most dangerous, and if Clover is defeated someone might be able to take them. Furthermore, Atlas reinforcements are coming which would make dealing with Clover probably impossible. These two factors make taking down Clover a higher priority than otherwise.
